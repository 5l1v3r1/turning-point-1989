Romania turns a nationalist socialist puppet of ussr and has a eternal event "fall of the peoples republic" that fires all the time.

Furthermore Operation Vijay does not fire and after 1960 Greece and Norway leave NATO.

- In all scenarios from 45-56, Floriano Peixoto is listed as Brazilian chief of the navy. The Floriano Peixoto appearing in the photo was president of Brazil from 1891 to 1894, dying one year later, being impossible to appear as minister even in the 14' scenario. I checked and instead found that there was a navy officer called Floriano Peixoto Faria Lima (being refered simply as 'Faria Lima'), who was some kind of representative of the navy to the government in the period of Jânio Quadros and Joao Goulart governments (1961-1964), and not since the end of WWII. I don't know if the Floriano Peixoto ingame was refering to this one. If it is, it should be renamed to 'Faria Lima' and have his picture changed. If it isn't, he should anyway not appear as a minister.

Are the Arab Federation events included. You know the federation of the two Hashemite kingdoms(Jordan and Iraq)?

Thanks for your answer Bizon (and Mery Christmas by the way , well in my game it it already January 1950 and there was no event about NATO creation. Oh well looks like i need to create my own NATO. By the way during my game I have an event about proposing USSR to create unified Germany, but in my game Germany was alredy unified, because my american troops manage to stop Soviet influnce on german-polish borders

Bizon, the Ethiopian coup still does not work correctly. Also when Commie China and Tibet go to war nothing happens for months and they peace out. Also in the 1959 the United Arab Republic should be there. Malaysia still does not get independence and I think the ministers for South Africa arent right, you should look at that.

Also the invasion of Goa doesn't work.
