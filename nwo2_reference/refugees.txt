Post war event suggestion. Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, Spain, Portugal and India should all get an event in which they all choose if they want have German refugees or not. If yes, they should get a tech bonus due to German technicians, but of course at the price of diplomatic relations with the allies and Comintern.

If I only made a list when I studied this. Anyways, this is a list over some of the most famous ones. It is mostly engineers and scientists related to aerospace engineering since this was my field of interest. Also, the German aerospace industry was shut down after WWII as producing engine powered aircraft was made illegal. Therefore, most of the German engineers and scientists that emigrated were not really refugees. It's more like: the exodus of German engineers and scientists after WWII
