Title :	Hungary
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi!

I was just packing up Hungary when I received your message. Great news, congrats on all that development! This will surely give me some boost, so I'll hurry up with ministers. As you said, some countries (even in Europe) lack even starting cabinets, so here is Hungary for the start (communist Hungary with democratic alternative). Altough Janos Kadar as general secretary of communist party was kinda de facto leader, I rather used formal leaders for HoS and HoG and used puppet traits for them as Kadar ruled more like from background and didn't show face to the world too much. Also, I made Hungary communist ministers LE because they were a bit softer than those hardliners in Czechoslovakia, DDR, Poland, Romania...Other WP nations will follow, then I need to resend Scandinavia, Soviet and Yugoslav revolters...then we'll see what still needs to be done.

Just a question, is it ok if I use fictional or real collective organs when there is no better replacement/lack of info in case of such replacement is need (radical changes of govement and such), like I did with that Commission for Popular Defence for Denmark? Those NATO commanders would probably be evacuated after Soviets invade, so it's better to use something like that when communists are put in power, isn't it?

Yes, if there's no better replacement you can, until someone with better knowledge or a native from the country gives us info, then we can fix along the patches. ;)[/QUOTE]
 
Ok, sounds fine. By the way, what are we going to do with military leaders? Can be simply pictureless generic ones used for now? It'd be still better than leaving WW2 ones in game like it was with Hoi2 release of this mod. However, this still means that they must have been at least generic names with ranks and everything in leader files, so there won't be only game-generated Major Generals who can't be promoted and don't get traits and experience appearing in game. Best to simply only delete pics of WW2 leaders and leave what is left in game, making them into random generals. Maybe only fully deleting most notable WW2 commanders, and Western name for some post-colonial states who fully cut their ties with colonial traditions (Arabs, some Asians...in Africa its okay cause natives inherited such names).

.......

At least for now, I didn't make communist cabinet for Sweden and Finland because it's not a priority (neutral countries that are not primary targets for USSR), but if Soviet player invades them anyway, they already have pretty left or mixed goverments and could keep them in power for sake of stability (late USSR also wouldn't care so much about ideology as it did in earlier stages). More incoming.

[QUOTE=hansnery]Just a quick question, are these ministers for what year? Because the scenario I'm currently working is on 1985.
Cheers.[/QUOTE]
 
All ministers I've done so far are for 1985, yes. If there were any later replacements, I specially noted it like in Iran where HoS and HoG are changed in 1989 (HoG-Ayatollah Homeini and HoS-President Khamenei change for new HoS-Ayatollah Khamenei and new HoG-president Rasfarjani after Khomeini's death in 1989). This was in fact the only case of special later year replacements by now. So if I haven't marked any special year for replacements like in that case, both starting ministers and all kinds of replacements are avalible since 1985 (scenario starts in March 1985 and I also took the month into account, so there shouldn't be any mistakes even according to month hopefully). 

Since it's already the oportunity, here are independent Belarus and Ukraine.

Title :	Re: Belarus & Ukraine
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[QUOTE=hansnery]Actually, the scenario starts in january. Starting in march was gll25's idea. But that's no problem since I'm doing the events using wikipedia for each year, so I'll probably know when a HoS and HoG dies.[/QUOTE]
 
Great, I think it won't be a problem because ministers are still generally accurate for that time. Also, I forgot to mention, communist Hungarian chief of staff dies somewhere at end of 1985 ( [url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istv%C3%A1n_Ol%C3%A1h[/url] ), you can simply sleep him for 1986 (changing his retire date in minister files) and his successor ( [url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferenc_K%C3%A1rp%C3%A1ti[/url] ) which I have added will automatically replace him. This successor is otherwise meant for democratic alternative, but he served both as his communist successor and then also for post-communist Hungary. Maybe you should simply make another communist version for that second guy, just use him and copy traits of his precedesor as doctrines shouldn't change until change of regime (but if democracy comes to Hungary, then he will turn from LE to SD and so will doctrines modernize as well).

Also, if ministers for countries with specific alphabet signs look strange in game or corrupt the files, feel free to simplifize them. I just noted in 1989 thread that existing cabinet for Yugoslavia doesen't have &#269;, &#263;, &#273; and other specific letters in names, so if any problems appear or even only due to esthetic reasons, you can use simplified English versions instead (you can help yourself with Wiki if in doubt, otherwise it can be easily transformed by logic in most cases). 

Now just a minor update: I remembered there aren't post-communist cabinets for Bulgaria and Romania yet. Even in IOTL transitions, big part of old aparatus survived into post-communist era due to being well-rooted in, but in our scenario (at least until there's a need for improvements), we could simply treat political changes in those two countries as reformist takeovers against old hardliners, so in case of fall of old regimes (occupations, coups...), most of old ministers can stay and only most notable hardliner frontmen are changed with reformists who then continue to rule in a bit repainted form of reformed old regimes.

[QUOTE=hansnery]Hello, I'm hansnery, and I come in behalf of Turning Point 1989 mod. I'm still making it though I'm ignoring people's conjectures about the mod. I'm working pretty much alone with the help of Asalto only, the other devs have forsaken the mod, one because of time and the other for selfish reasons(I will adress that better when I create a new topic for the mod). But I come here to ask the help of the mds mod, there are some material that could use to make the development of TP faster (like SKIFs or even data material) and I ask permission for the use of some of them, I will give the proper credits of course.

Title :	Yugoslavia alternatives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I didn't have alternatives for Yugoslavia before, only breakaway republic. But then I remembered it could still be released under new regime, plus it'd be plausible (there were ideas for democratic and united Yugoslavia, and there was always a chance of Serbian military hawks taking over too). So I made democratic and militarist alternative too now (I also used lots of ministers from existing Yugoslav cabinet and other post-Yugoslav states, so it wasn't too much work).

[QUOTE=hansnery]Hi, I'm using the minister's ideology for the ideology of the country, since they are not set yet and I don't know the ideology of every country. If there's any particular case of different minister ideology and his country, please tell me.
:D[/QUOTE]
 
It's okay to use ideology that is used by most of ministers. Maybe only in Scandinavia where SC are in power, it's better to use Market Liberal as general ideology as their conservativism isn't so traditionalist in general level (so Norway and Denmark are better suited as ML than SC). Sweden was real traditional SD back then, so you can use SD for general ideology too. As for communists, maybe Czechoslovakia should be ST in general altough it had mostly LE ministers because ministers were more reformist leaning but system was very rigid. Others you can do according to minister traits.

[QUOTE=hansnery]Some info: I've finished Land Doctrines (lacking testing) and will be doing Secret Weapons from now on (need ideas!). I think soon enough the tech tree will be done and the ministers, from there we'll need info about OOBs and Tech Teams. And later, events and decisions, then, the game will be ready! :D[/QUOTE]
 
Hey,

Glad to hear all that! I'll send you more material when I'll be back from vacation (very soon). I'll also try to help with OOBs, TTs and if possible also with events (I'm pretty amateurish with event mechanics, but I'll try to help at least with essence). And new ministers (and also military leaders) will be still being made snd delivered (but first I'll send you everything I have left with ministers). As for secret weapons, should we also reconsider experimental approaches? It's CW mod after all, with all misterious reasearch and everything. Of course no need to go for weather control and such, but maybe something like drones, robots...that would then unlock such techs in regular tech tree.

Make general ideology of Mexico Social Liberal with sliders strongly pro-free market, altough not 100%. Here is Madrid's successor for 1988 election. When making an event, make stronger possibility of his victory, but leftist splinter from mainstream party should also have small chance (about 25%?). PRI presidental candidate, rest of cabinet stays as it is, traits turn even more free market:

And here is cabinet for leftist fraction of PRI winning elections or for the case of forceful takeover (revolution, Soviet puppet or something similar). Foreign minister and chief of navy stay the same as before, MoS and MoI gets replaced only if traits turn very leftist, otherwise old MoS and MoI can stay. So for election event for this group, just add changes for HoS, HoG, MoA and military leadership except navy (CoS, CoA, CoAF). Also, traits turn more leftist (more central planning and Social Democrat general ideology).

Back to your last message, I'm happy to hear that you're already working on events. You'll probably focus on WW3 mounting (internal crisis, coup, conflict?) ? As for tech teams, I will finish ministers first, but otherwise solid set of TTs will be probably really needed only for most important and semi-important states (superpowers, regional and local powerhouses). For totally irrelevant statists I think there even isn't need for TTs at all (tiny insular countries like Bahamas). So big ones would have nice sets of TTs, smaller ones would have specific sets and maybe some that are not really important but would still need TTs could share single generic TT or something (called ''research department'' or something with basic traits and low exp. and with some neutral pic).

Also, as for really tiny nations like in Micronesia and tiny states in Caribbean Antilles, there is probably no need to have them in as independent states? It'd be okay if they'd be banded together in single nations in supernational forms that exist IRL, like Caribbean (CARICOM) and Pacific Community? It would look sloppy if bigger tiny fish like Haiti would be included in that, but for Martinique, Fiji and others it would still make sense.

[QUOTE=hansnery]About the micronations, that's no problem so far. DH has a lot of IDs for countries. About the TTs, we can proceed like that for now. 
I've already finished events for 1985 and I'm going to 1986 soon. I've been reading a lot and I think that WW3 even with the "hardliners" and those from the august putsch, would be very unlikely. Still, we gotta bring some fun to the game huh? :D[/QUOTE]
 
Okay with micronations then, hopefully they won't cause too much game lag, otherwise I'm okay with them. As for storyline, please don't let yourself be bothered with my questions, I don't want to suggest how it should be done. I'd be totally fine with every path you chose. While many people would probably want WW3 focuss, I think continued CW with all those intrigues would be also nice. What about making things with event paths similar to NWO mod or something, leaving broad spectrum of options? Something like focus around such important choices:
1. Coup against Gorbachev: YES/NO
2. Large Soviet internal problems - disolve USSR and WP: YES/NO 
3. WW3: YES/NO
4. Post-USSR: Revanchist or cooperative Russia: YES/NO

Or maybe WW3 shouldn't be possible only due to nationalistic agenda for hardliners but more like due to mere question of Soviet survival, to prevent collapse of Soviet empire? Maybe there should be also option for Gorbachev reforms to succed (only limited intervention of hardliners to prevent larger political reforms but keep economic ones, making USSR something like China?). In such case, USSR would be soon able to successfully continue rivalry with West, continuing with cold war schemes like support for friendly regimes, funding rebels and revolutions etc. But I trust in your plans, so good luck with further event paths.

I think that considering popularity of Japanese emperor, even Soviets would leave him in power, at least for some time, so I decided to leave him be if communist takeover happens. Since it was already damn hard to get only Japanese chief of staff already, he and security minister can also stay as they aren't considered too political (so there could be some kind of tactical collaboration with Soviets in Japanese case). Those mainstream communists also aren't really extreme, so such setup isn't too unplausible.

Title :	Vietnam
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I must say I'm pretty proud on non-communist alternative for Vietnam, it was quite a fun putting together late leaders and commanders of South Vietnam that would be suitable at least for provisional post-communist rule as well (I imagine that'd be in case of massive US operations in Southeast Asia, if such mess breaks out, Vietnamese exiles would probably lead exile troops attached to US/Thai or whatever ally). And communist cabinet is pretty perfect as well, so everything's ready for another Indochina campaign. Otherwise general ideology for those countries should be LE (Socialist) as they were pro-Soviet and anti-Maoist/Chinese (had softer Khruschevite ideological traits). Laos and Cambodia should be Vietnamese puppets (and don't forget to use flag of pro-Vietnamese People's Republic of Kampuchea, not similar Red Khmer ''Democratic Kampuchea'' one). It'd be also good to add royal/modern day flag of Cambodia in case of regime change as well. Same thing for Vietnam and also Laos. Cabinets for Vietnam and Laos incoming.

By the way, you don't have ministers for Indonesia and Philippines yet, do you? I don't remember anyone ever said to me that they lack, but I got a feeling they aren't there yet. I actually already collected them, is it ok if I send them? 

Also, I must say I'm pretty proud on Thai cabinet, I actually had to research meaning of traditional Thai sun calendar to be able to translate reign of some of those ministers from Thai Wiki. I'm not sure about general ideology for Thailand, politics were still military-dominated in 1980s, but were going trough liberalization and this goverment is still legal political govt and not military junta. So I decided to mark ministers simply with SC because they are traditionalists but weren't too autocratic in that age anymore (PA would be suitable for more radical nationalistic-authoritarian govt while FA would be pure paternal autocracy). I suggest you make starting Thai general traits some kind of authoritarian Social Conservative (maybe a slider away from PA).
