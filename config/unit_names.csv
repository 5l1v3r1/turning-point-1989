LDESC_INFANTRY;The modern division had become in many militaries the primary identifiable combat unit during the second half of the 20th century, supplanting the brigade, however the trend has been reversing during the Cold War. The peak of use of the division as the primary combat unit was during World War II, when over a thousand divisions were deployed by the belligerents.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_BRIGADE;A brigade is a major tactical military formation that is typically composed of three to six battalions, plus supporting elements depending on the era and nationality of a given army and could be perceived as an enlarged/reinforced regiment. Usually, a brigade is a sub-component of a division, a larger unit consisting of two or more brigades. Brigades formed into divisions are usually infantry or armoured (sometimes referred to as combined arms brigades), in addition to combat units they may include combat support units or sub-units such as artillery and engineers, and logistic units or sub-units.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_SPECIAL_FORCES;Special forces, or special operations forces are military units highly-trained to perform unconventional, often high-risk missions.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_AIR_CAVALRY;Air mobility has been a key concept in offensive operations since the 1930s. Initial approaches to air mobility focused on airborne and glider-borne troops. During World War II many assaults were done by military gliders. Following the war faster aircraft led to the abandonment of the flimsy wooden gliders with the then new helicopters taking their place.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_CAVALRY;Armoured cavalry began to replace horse cavalry as the reconnaissance arm in most armies after the First World War, although many armies continued to maintain horse cavalry through the end of the Second World War. It differed from regular armour units in that the main AFVs were armoured cars or scout cars, with some light or medium tanks.;" motorcycle troops or infantry in trucks or half-tracks rounded out the unit.""";.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_MOTORIZED;Motorized Infantry make use of wheeled vehicles, such as trucks, to manoeuvre more rapidly than basic Infantry. But they are limited to roads and so their performance may suffer in provinces with low infrastructure levels.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_MECHANIZED;Mechanized Infantry are equipped with all-terrain vehicles, such as the halftrack, which does not limit them to roads as with Motorized Infantry and allows them to work well with armoured units. However, the specialist equipment they require means their cost is high.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_LIGHT_ARMOR;An armoured personnel carrier (APC) is an armoured fighting vehicle designed to transport infantry to the battlefield. APCs are usually armed with only a machine gun although variants carry recoilless rifles, anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), or mortars. They are not usually designed to take part in a direct-fire battle, but to carry troops to the battlefield safe from shrapnel and ambush. They may have wheels or tracks.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_ARMOR;Armoured units allow real projection of power on the battlefield. Their speed and firepower make them lethal against all but the best entrenched Infantry. However, as tanks became heaver, their speeds would reduce accordingly.  They also required a constant supply of fuel to remain in the field, and if this vital supply was severed, the armoured unit would be next to useless.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_PARATROOPER;Paratroopers are an elite branch of the Infantry, specifically trained to either parachute to the ground or be ferried to a battle in gliders. Their rapid deployment capability makes them ideal for use as a mobile reserve or for use in capturing a strategic asset behind enemy lines. However, they are handicapped by a lack of heavy equipment due to their mode of travel, and when they are in action it is advisable to move other units to their support.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_MARINE;Marines are an elite branch of the Infantry, specifically trained for assaulting beaches and other naval operations. They make use of specialised equipment and tactics to give them an edge over regular Infantry in such an environment.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_BERGSJAEGER;Mountain Troops are an elite branch of the Infantry, specifically trained for operations in mountainous terrain.  They make use of specialised equipment and tactics to give them an edge over regular Infantry in such an environment.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_GARRISON;Garrison Divisions are second line troops used to safeguard valuable objectives far from the front lines. They lack heavy equipment and transportation, making them immobile except for strategic redeployment. They have limited fighting capability but can be used to free more capable troops for frontline use.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_HQ;Headquarters are the brains of your armed forces. They contain the staff that keeps your army running, such as logistics and planning staff. They give a bonus to the units fighting in the vicinity but it is advisable to guard them, as their own fighting ability is poor.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_ATTACK_HELICOPTER;An attack helicopter is a military helicopter with the primary role of an attack aircraft, with the capability of engaging targets on the ground, such as enemy infantry and armored vehicles. Attack helicopters are designed to maximize the helicopter’s intrinsic abilities to exploit terrain for cover and to loiter closely over a battlefield in order to provide immediate close air support. These helicopters carry a myriad of weaponry to engage ground targets, including guided air-to-ground missiles, autocannon, rockets, and machine guns. Attack helicopters can also carry air-to-air missiles, but these are intended only for self-defense.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_CAS;WWII cemented the importance of close air support (CAS) in warfare and the need for specialized CAS aircraft. Although fighters can perform CAS missions, specialized CAS aircraft possess better handling characteristics at the low speeds and altitude that characterize CAS missions. CAS aircraft must also be able to carry plenty of ordnance, precisely target the enemy’s positions, possess the ability to loiter over the battlefield, and be able to stay aloft despite taking heavy damage.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_INTERCEPTOR;An air superiority fighter is a type of fighter aircraft intended to gain air superiority in a war, by entering and seizing control of enemy airspace. Air superiority fighters are designed to effectively engage enemy fighters, more than other types of aircraft. They are usually more expensive and procured in smaller numbers than multirole fighters.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_MULTI_ROLE;A multirole fighter is a combat aircraft designed to perform many different combat missions previously relegated to special-purpose aircraft. In addition to its air-to-air combat role, a multirole fighter can also, for instance, also operate as a reconnaissance, ground attack, maritime interdiction, and air defense aircraft. The motivation for developing a multirole fighter is usually to reduce the number of different models of aircraft among allies, and to reduce supply and logistical costs.;" in other words, an aircraft whose various roles include, among others, the role of air-to-air combat.""";.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_ESCORT;The Naval Patrol is designed for use over water and make accurate tactical strikes against enemy surface vessels using torpedoes or armour-piercing bombs.  They have a limited dog-fighting capability, which makes them vulnerable if intercepted by fighters.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_STRATEGIC_BOMBER;Strategic bombers destroy the economic and industrial capability of an enemy state to make war by systematically bombing cities, factories, and infrastructure. The advent of nuclear weapons gives strategic bombers unprecedented destructive potential. Furthermore, the strategic bomber’s long range and loiter time gives it a strategic second strike capability in a mutually-assured destruction scenario. Modern strategic bombers rely on speed and stealth to perform their mission.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_TACTICAL_BOMBER;Strike bombers are aircraft designed to attack ground targets with greater precision than strategic bombers. They differ from close air support aircraft in the scope of their intended mission: strike bombers generally perform more interdiction and long range attack missions than CAS aircraft, but the roles of the two types of aircraft overlap significantly. Strike bombers also carry a larger payload than CAS aircraft, enabling them to effectively target enemy installations.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_TRANSPORT_PLANE;Transport Planes are designed to ferry men and materials over long distances quickly. Paratroops need Transport Planes in order to make a paradrop.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_BATTLESHIP;The aircraft cruiser or cruiser-carrier was originally a 1930s experimental concept of creating an all-around warship, trying to combine all the good features of the aircraft carrier and the heavy cruiser. The early aircraft cruisers were usually armed with relatively heavy artillery, mines and a number of aircraft fitted with floats. A more modern derivative of the aircraft cruiser is the helicopter cruiser. The Invincible-class aircraft carriers of the Royal Navy can also be considered;" they were originally classed as cruisers due to their original role as command and control platforms as well as ASW vessels, taking on those roles from the RN's ''Tiger'' class cruiser conversions. In the Russian Navy, ""Aviation Cruiser"" is a designation for the Kiev-class and Kuznetsov-class ships. They are a cross between cruiser and aircraft carrier and are divided in two classes, the aviation cruisers and the heavy aviation cruisers.";.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_LIGHT_CRUISER;In modern navies, Frigates are used to protect other warships and merchant-marine ships, especially as anti-submarine warfare (ASW) combatants for amphibious expeditionary forces, underway replenishment groups, and merchant convoys.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_HEAVY_CRUISER;In the later 20th century, the obsolescence of the battleship left the cruiser as the largest and most powerful surface combatant. The role of the cruiser varied according to ship and navy, often including air defense, commerce raiding and shore bombardment. The U.S. Navy in the Cold War period built guided-missile cruisers primarily designed to provide air defense, while the navy of the USSR built cruisers with heavy anti-ship missiles designed to sink NATO carrier task forces.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_BATTLECRUISER;A helicopter carrier is a type of aircraft carrier whose primary purpose is to operate helicopters. Helicopter carriers have been used as anti-submarine warfare carriers and amphibious assault ships.Helicopter carriers can either have a full-length aircraft deck like HMS Ocean, or have a large helicopter deck, usually aft, as in the Soviet Navy's Moskva class or RFA Argus. A full-length deck maximises deck space for helicopter landing spots. Such a design also allows for a hangar deck.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_DESTROYER;The Destroyer is the smallest and the fastest of the surface ships. It is lightly armed in comparison with the battleship, but its speed and maneuverability allow it to provide a good first line of defence away from the main capital ships of a fleet, and its light guns are useful for engaging aircraft. Destroyers are usually combined in groups and used for convoy escort and anti-submarine duties.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_CARRIER;An aircraft carrier is a warship designed with a primary mission of deploying and recovering aircraft, acting as a seagoing airbase. Aircraft carriers thus allow a naval force to project airpower worldwide without having to depend on local bases for staging aircraft operations. Aircraft carriers are typically the capital ship of a fleet, and are extremely expensive to build and important to protect.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_SUBMARINE;The Submarine is designed to travel underwater allowing it to operate clandestinely against other naval units. Its main armament consists of torpedoes which are deadly against all other types of vessel, be they Carrier, Battleship, Naval Transport or another Submarine. However, the Submarine can be handicapped by a short range and new technologies to improve them can be expensive.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_TRANSPORT;Naval Transports are used for moving supplies and resources around the world. They can also be used to ferry land units across stretches of water. They are completely unarmed and, unless well protected, will be vulnerable to attack by other naval units or aircraft.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_MILITIA;Militia are a cheap and rapidly formed Infantry unit. Their hurried training and poor equipment mean they are of little use in combat, although they can be useful for controlling territory and as a last line of defence when no other units are available.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_NAVAL_BOMBER;The Naval Patrol is designed for use over water and make accurate tactical strikes against enemy surface vessels using torpedoes or armour-piercing bombs.  They have a limited dog-fighting capability, which makes them vulnerable if intercepted by fighters.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_FLYING_BOMB;The Flying Bomb (e.g. the German V1) is a pilotless aircraft powered by an early jet engine, designed to deliver a payload of explosives to an area target. It is slower than a rocket or missile, which means that it can be intercepted and shot down by enemy fighters.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_FLYING_ROCKET;The Rocket or Ballistic Missile (e.g. the German V2) is designed to deliver a payload of explosives to a distant target. Its high speed makes it almost impossible to intercept but it is an expensive way of destroying the enemy with conventional explosives.  Nuclear weapons are needed to give it more than psychological effect.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_ESCORT_CARRIER;The Light Carrier became an important naval vessel later in the war. Its ability to protect convoys, actively hunt submarines and support amphibious operations through the aircraft it carries made it very useful and cost effective, freeing up the more expensive fleet carriers for other tasks. The ships themselves, however, are only lightly armed, lightly armored, and of far smaller displacement than fleet carriers.;Le porte-avions lйger devenait une partie importante des flottes pendant le cours de la guerre. Sa capacitй de protйger les convois, de chasser des sous-marins et de soutenir des embarquements amphibies faisait que les grands porte-avions йtaient libre pour des autres tвches. Les Bateaux eux-mкmes ont par contre des armes et armures relativement faibles et sont beaucoup moins fort que les porte-avions normaux. ;La Portaerei Leggera divenne un'importante unita' navale verso la fine della guerra. La sua capacita' di protezione dei convogli, la caccia ai sottomarini e il supporto alle operazioni anfibie con l'utilizzo di forze aeree trasportate ne fecero un mezzo utile ed economico, lasciando disponibili le piu' costose Portaerei di Flotta per altri ruoli. La Portaerei Leggera era pero' dotata di un minore armamento e corazzatura e in generale meno potenti delle Portaerei di Flotta.;El portaaviones ligero se convirtiу en un navнo importante avanzada la guerra. Su capacidad para proteger convoyes, cazar submarinos activamente y apoyar las operaciones anfibias mediante las aeronaves que transportaba lo hicieron muy eficaz y rentable, pues asн se pudieron destinar a los portaaviones de la flota mбs caros a otros cometidos. No obstante, los propios buques sуlo van ligeramente armados y blindados y tienen un desplazamiento bastante inferior al de otros portaaviones de la flota.;Der Geleittrдger wurde mit fortschreiten des Krieges ein wichtiger Bestandteil der Flotten. Seine Fдhigkeit Konvois zu schьtzen, aktiv U-Bote zu jagen und Amphibienlandungen zu unterstьtzen machte ihn zu einem guten kosteneffizienten Fahrzeug was die groЯen Trдgerschiffe fьr andere Aufgaben freihielt. Die Schiffe selbst sind jedoch nur leicht bewaffnet und gepanzert und um vieles kleiner als normale Flugzeugtrдger.;Lekki lotniskowiec staі siк waїn№ jednostk№ morsk№ w pуџniejszym okresie wojny. Moїliwoњж ochrony konwojуw, tropienia i niszczenia okrкtуw podwodnych a takїe wspierania dziaіaс desantowych dziкki przenoszonym samolotom uczyniіy z niego okrкt opіacalny i bardzo uїyteczny.

Lekkie lotniskowce s№ jednakїe uzbrojone jedynie w broс lekk№, posiadaj№ sіaby pancerz i maj№ o wiele mniejsz№ wypornoњж niї lotniskowce floty. ;;Ближе к окончанию войны для защиты конвоев, поиска и уничтожения подлодок противника, при проведении десантных операций стали использоваться легкие авианосцы. Широкий спектр выполняемых задач очень скоро сделал их незаменимыми, что позволяло высвободить более дорогие крупные авианосцы для самых сложных и ответственных операций. Легкие авианосцы имели относительно слабую бронезащиту и вооружение, а также намного меньшее водоизмещение.;;;X

LDESC_ARTILLERY;Artillery pieces will increase the 'Soft Attack' capability of your units, inflicting more damage on Infantry and Motorized units.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_SP_ARTILLERY;SP, or Self-Propelled, Artillery gives your armored and mechanized units an additional punch against enemy infantry while not reducing the speed of those units as much as normal artillery.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_SP_ANTI_AIR;SP, or Self-Propelled, Anti Air Artillery gives your armored and mechanized units added capability against Air units such as Close air attack planes. They are very effective against enemy air units, and do not reduce the speed of your fast units like normal AA artillery.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X

LDESC_SP_ROCKET_ARTILLERY;SP, or Self-Propelled, Anti Air Artillery gives your armored and mechanized units added capability against Air units such as Close air attack planes. They are very effective against enemy air units, and do not reduce the speed of your fast units like normal AA artillery.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_TANK_DESTROYER;Tank Destroyers are similar to normal Tanks. The difference is that they don't have a rotating turret, and mount most of their armor to the front. They give your units an added capability against hard targets such as enemy armor.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_LIGHT_ARMOR_BRIG;An armoured personnel carrier (APC) is an armoured fighting vehicle designed to transport infantry to the battlefield. APCs are usually armed with only a machine gun although variants carry recoilless rifles, anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), or mortars. They are not usually designed to take part in a direct-fire battle, but to carry troops to the battlefield safe from shrapnel and ambush. They may have wheels or tracks.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_HEAVY_ARMOR;An infantry fighting vehicle (IFV), is a type of armoured fighting vehicle used to carry infantry into battle and provide fire support. They are differentiated from APCs—which are purely transport vehicles, armed only for self-defence—because they are designed to give direct fire support to the dismounted infantry and so usually have significantly enhanced armament. IFVs also often have improved armour and some have firing ports (allowing the infantry to fire personal weapons while mounted).;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_SUPER_HEAVY_ARMOR;Super Heavy Armor is the ultimate shock weapon. Nearly impossible to kill, they give horrendous bonuses to your units' hard and soft attack values. They also consume enormous amounts of supplies and fuel, and slow your units to a crawl.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_ARMORED_CAR;Armored Cars are wheeled vehicles, typically with light armour and modest weaponry. They give your units an added capability against soft targets, being most effective against supply trucks and rear area troops.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_ANTITANK;Armoured units allow real projection of power on the battlefield. Their speed and firepower make them lethal against all but the best entrenched Infantry. However, as tanks became heaver, their speeds would reduce accordingly.  They also required a constant supply of fuel to remain in the field, and if this vital supply was severed, the armoured unit would be next to useless.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_ANTIAIR;Anti-Aircraft weapons will increase the 'Air Attack' capability of your units, so that they inflict more damage on Aircraft.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_ENGINEER;Engineer Brigades help crossing rivers, making the process quicker and reducing disorganisation.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_POLICE;Police Brigades are good at suppressing partisans and rebels.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X
LDESC_CAG;Carrier Air Groups represent the complement of planes stationed on carriers which provide both protection for the carrier and allow it to strike enemy ships at a large distance. The multi-role aircraft has a carrier based variant that is purposefully built for carrier operations and unlike its land based variant, the MRCAG also boasts a reasonable sea attack capability.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;.;X

The doctrine behind the use of missile boats is based on the principle of mobility over defence.

SNAME_BOAT;FAC;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_BOAT;A fast attack craft (FAC) is a small, fast, agile and offensive warship armed with anti-ship missiles, gun and/or torpedoes. FACs are usually operated in close proximity to land as they lack both the seakeeping and all-round defensive capabilities to survive in blue water. The size of the vessel also limits the fuel, stores and water supplies. In size they are usually between 50–400 tonnes and can reach speeds of 25–50 knots. A fast attack craft's main advantage over other warship types is its affordability. Many FACs can be deployed at a relatively low cost, allowing a navy which is at a disadvantage to effectively defend itself against a larger adversary. A small boat, when equipped with the same weapons as its larger counterpart, can pose a serious threat to even the largest of capital ships.; in fact, the first missile boats were modified torpedo boats replacing two or more torpedo tubes with missile tubes. The doctrine behind the use of missile boats is based on the principle of mobility over defence. The advent of proper missile and electronic counter measure technologies gave birth to the idea that, because a missile is far more accurate than a shell and can penetrate even the most heavily armored ship hulls, warships should now be designed to outmaneuver their enemies and get to a better position first. Moreover, increasing the potency of shells requires employing larger projectiles, which necessitates larger naval guns and consequently, larger platforms to carry these guns. This trend culminated in the giant battleships of WWII. The ability to deploy anti-ship missiles on small, maneuverable platforms seriously negates the advantages that were provided by larger ships in the era before the advent of guided missiles. A small missile boat, when equipped with sophisticated guided anti-ship missiles can pose a serious threat to even the largest of capital ships, and do so at much greater ranges than is possible with torpedoes.;;;;;;;;;X

LDESC_AEWC;An airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) system is an airborne radar picket system designed to detect aircraft, ships and vehicles at long ranges and perform control and command of the battle space in an air engagement by directing fighter and attack aircraft strikes. AEW&C units are also used to carry out surveillance, including over ground targets and frequently perform C2BM (command and control, battle management) functions similar to an Airport Traffic Controller given military command over other forces. When used at altitude, the radar on the aircraft allows the operators to detect and track targets and distinguish between friendly and hostile aircraft much farther away than a similar ground based radar. Like a ground based radar, it can be detected by opposing forces, but because of its mobility, it is much less vulnerable to counter-attack.;;;;;;;;;;X
