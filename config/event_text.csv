restore_warsaw_pact_desc;Beginning in the late 1970s, the Soviets carefully noted that one of the Warsaw Pact's most important functions was monitoring the ''fraternal countries and the fulfillment of their duties in the joint defense of socialism''. When forces that are hostile to socialism try to turn the development of some socialist country towards capitalism, it becomes not only a problem of the country concerned, but a common problem and concern of all socialist countries. That is, no country could leave the Warsaw Pact or disturb a ruling communist party's monopoly on power.;;;;;;;;;;X

money_supply_decreases_desc;Our high interest rates has slowed the growth of money supply. Higher interest rates reduce the amount of money because fewer people seek loans, and loans are usually made with new money. When banks make loans, they usually first create new money, then lend it. A central bank usually creates money lent to a national government. Therefore, when a person pays back a loan, the bank destroys the money and the quantity of money falls.;;;;;;;;;;X

foreign_investment;Foreign Investment;;;;;;;;;;X
foreign_investment_desc;As increased globalization in business has occurred, it's become very common for big companies to branch out and invest money in companies located in other countries. These companies may be opening up new manufacturing plants and attracted to cheaper labor, production, and fewer taxes in another country. They may make a foreign investment in another firm outside of their country because the firm being purchased has specific technology, products, or access to additional customers that the purchasing firm wants. Overall, foreign investment in a country is a good sign that often leads to growth of jobs and income. As more foreign investment comes into a country, it can lead to even greater investments because others see the country as economically stable.;;;;;;;;;;X
capital_flight;Capital Flight;;;;;;;;;;X
capital_flight_desc;Capital flight occurs when assets or money rapidly flow out of a country, due to an event of economic consequence. Such events could be an increase in taxes on capital or capital holders or the government of the country defaulting on its debt that disturbs investors and causes them to lower their valuation of the assets in that country, or otherwise to lose confidence in its economic strength. This leads to a disappearance of wealth, and is usually accompanied by a sharp drop in the exchange rate of the affected country - depreciation in a variable exchange rate regime, or a forced devaluation in a fixed exchange rate regime. This fall is particularly damaging when the capital belongs to the people of the affected country, because not only are the citizens now burdened by the loss in the economy and devaluation of their currency, but probably also, their assets have lost much of their nominal value. This leads to dramatic decreases in the purchasing power of the country's assets and makes it increasingly expensive to import goods and acquire in form of foreign facilities i.e. medical facilities.;;;;;;;;;;X

reinstate_brezhnev_doctrine_desc;"When forces that are hostile to socialism try to turn the development of some socialist country towards capitalism, it becomes not only a problem of the country concerned, but a common problem and concern of all socialist countries. This doctrine was announced to retroactively justify the invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968 that ended the Prague Spring, along with earlier Soviet military interventions, such as the invasion of Hungary in 1956. These interventions were meant to put an end to liberalization efforts and uprisings that had the potential to compromise Soviet hegemony inside the Eastern Bloc, which was considered by the Soviets to be an essential defensive and strategic buffer in case hostilities with NATO were to break out. In practice, the policy meant that only limited independence of the satellite states' communist parties was allowed and that no country would be allowed to compromise the cohesiveness of the Eastern Bloc in any way. That is, no country could leave the Warsaw Pact or disturb a ruling communist party's monopoly on power. Implicit in this doctrine was that the leadership of the Soviet Union reserved, for itself, the right to define ''socialism"" and ''capitalism"".";;;;;;;;;;X

The Memorandum was adopted despite opposition from 83 Serb deputies, belonging to the Serb Democratic Party as well as the Serbian Renewal Movement and the Union of Reform Forces, who regarded the move as illegal. On 24 October 1991, the Serb deputies formed the Assembly of the Serb People in Bosnia and Herzegovina to be the highest representative and legislative body of the Serb population, ending the tripartite coalition. The Union of Reform Forces soon ceased to exist but its members remained in the assembly as the Independent Members of Parliament Caucus. The assembly undertook to address the achievement of equality between the Serbs and other peoples and the protection of the Serbs' interests jeopardized by decisions of the Bosnian parliament.

This ancient symbol was known as the Vergina Sun or Vergina Star, named after the Greek town where it had been discovered in archaeological excavations of the ancient Macedonian city of Aigai. The Vergina Sun was regarded by Greece as a symbol of continuity between ancient Macedonia and modern Greek culture, and in particular as a symbol of the Argead dynasty of Philip II of Macedon and his son Alexander the Great. It had also been adopted by many in the then Socialist Republic of Macedonia to symbolise historical connections between that country and ancient Macedon and had been paraded in demonstrations by ethnic Macedonians at home and abroad.

Zulfikarpasic believed that Bosnia could benefit from a union with Serbia, Montenegro, and Krajina, thus he supported a union which would secure the unity of Serbs and Bosniaks. Milosevic continued negotiations with Zulfikarpasic to include Bosnia within a new Yugoslavia, however efforts to include the whole of Bosnia within a new Yugoslavia effectively terminated by late 1991 as Izetbegovic planned to hold a referendum on independence while the Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats formed autonomous territories.;;;;;;;;;;X

However, given that Belgrade's authorities had neither intervened to prevent Macedonia's departure, nor protested nor acted against the arrival of the UN troops, the indications were in place that once Belgrade was to form its new country, it would recognise the Republic of Macedonia and develop diplomatic relations with it.

The Vance plan consisted of two agreements. The first agreement, known as the Geneva Accord, was signed by Yugoslav defence minister General Veljko Kadijevic, President of Serbia Slobodan Milosevic and Croatian President Franjo Tudman in Geneva, Switzerland, on 23 November 1991. Because the ceasefire agreed at that time did not hold, further negotiations resulted in the Implementation Agreement of 2 January 1992.

On the morning of 26 June, units of the Yugoslav People's Army's 13th Corps left their barracks in Rijeka, Croatia, to move towards Slovenia's borders with Italy. The move immediately led to a strong reaction from local Slovenians, who organized spontaneous barricades and demonstrations against the YPA's actions. There was, as yet, no fighting, and both sides appeared to have an unofficial policy of not being the first to open fire. By this time, the Slovenian government had already put into action its plan to seize control of both the international Ljubljana Airport and the Slovenia's border posts on borders with Italy, Austria and Hungary. The personnel manning the border posts were, in most cases, already Slovenians, so the Slovenian take-over mostly simply amounted to changing of uniforms and insignia, without any fighting. By taking control of the borders, the Slovenians were able to establish defensive positions against an expected YPA attack. This meant that the YPA would have to fire the first shot.

yug_state_of_emergency_desc;On 12 March 1991, the leadership of the Army met with the Presidency in an attempt to convince them to declare a state of emergency which would allow for the pan-Yugoslav army to take control of the country. In the meeting, a vote was taken on a proposal to enact martial law to allow for military action to end the crisis in Croatia by providing protection for the Serbs. The proposal was rejected as the Bosnian delegate Bogic Bogicevic voted against it, believing that there was still the possibility of diplomacy being able to solve the crisis. The Yugoslav Presidency crisis reached an impasse in when Sapunxhiu 'defected' his faction in the second vote on martial law in March 1991. Jovic briefly resigned from the presidency in protest, but soon returned. On 16 May 1991, the Serbian parliament replaced Kosovo's Riza Sapunxhiu with Sejdo Bajramovic, and Vojvodina's Nenad Bucin with Jugoslav Kostic. This effectively deadlocked the Presidency, because Milosevic's Serbian faction had secured four out of eight federal presidency votes and it was able to block any unfavorable decisions at the federal level, in turn causing objections from other republics and calls for reform of the Yugoslav Federation.;;;;;;;;;;X

party_crisis_desc;In January 1990, the extraordinary 14th Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia was convened. The combined Yugoslav ruling party, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (SKJ), was in crisis. Most of the Congress was spent with the Serbian and Slovene delegations arguing over the future of the League of Communists and Yugoslavia. SR Croatia's actions in preventing Serb protesters from reaching Slovenia played its part. The Serbian delegation, led by Milosevic, insisted on a policy of ''one person, one vote'' in the party membership, which would empower the largest party ethnic group, the Serbs. In turn, the Croats and Slovenes sought to reform Yugoslavia by delegating even more power to six republics, but were voted down continuously in every motion in an attempt to force the party to adopt the new voting system. As a result, the Croatian delegation, led by Chairman Ivica Racan, and Slovene delegation left the Congress on 23 January 1990, effectively dissolving the all-Yugoslav party. This in turn, along with external pressure, caused the adoption of multi-party systems in all republics.;;;;;;;;;;X

gazimestan_speech_desc;The Gazimestan speech was a speech given on 28 June 1989 by Slobodan Milosevic, then President of Serbia. It was the centrepiece of a day-long event to mark the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo, which spelled the defeat of the medieval Serbian kingdom at the hands of the Ottoman Empire, as well as the annexation of most of Serbia's territory aside from the Serbian Despotate. The speech was delivered to a huge crowd gathered at the place where the battle had been fought, Gazimestan in the Central Kosovo. It came against a backdrop of intense ethnic tension between ethnic Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo and increasing political tensions between Serbia and the other constituent republics of the then Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia caused by the ''anti-bureaucratic revolution''. The speech has since become famous for Milosevic's reference to the possibility of ''armed battles'', in the future of Serbia's national development. Many commentators have described this as presaging the collapse of Yugoslavia...;;;;;;;;;;X

Before the event, they tried to compromise and negotiate with Milosevic, expressing cautious support for the constitutional changes while trying to keep their and Vojvodina's position intact. However, the avalanche of media campaign orchestrated from Belgrade was about to overwhelm them, they were labelled as power-hungry ''armchairers'' and ''autonomists''.The Vojvodina government then cut off power and water supply to protesters, a move which enraged them further still, and caused even more people from Novi Sad and its vicinity to join. When power was restored, they tried a different tactic: in order to cheer the demonstrators up, they gave them bread and yogurt. However, thousands of yogurt packages were soon thrown at the Parliament building by angry protesters. On October 6, the entire collective leadership of Vojvodina resigned and were soon replaced with Milosevic's men of trust.;;;;;;;;;;X

rise_of_milosevic_desc;Slobodan Milosevic emerged in 1987 as a force in Serbian politics after he declared support for Serbs in Kosovo, who claimed they were being oppressed by the government of the Serbian autonomous province of Kosovo, which was dominated by Kosovo's majority nationality, ethnic Albanians. Milosevic claimed that Albanian authorities had abused their powers, that the autonomy of Kosovo was allowing the entrenchment of separatism in Kosovo, and that the rights of the minority Serbs in Kosovo were being regularly violated. As a solution, he called for political change to reduce the autonomy of Kosovo, protect minority Serb rights, and initiate a strong crackdown on separatism in Kosovo. Milosevic assured Serbs that their mistreatment by ethnic Albanians would be stopped. He then began a campaign against the ruling communist elite of SR Serbia, demanding reductions in the autonomy of Kosovo and Vojvodina. These actions made him popular amongst Serbs and aided his rise to power in Serbia. Milosevic and his allies took on an aggressive nationalist agenda of reviving SR Serbia within Yugoslavia, promising reforms and protection of all Serbs.;;;;;;;;;;X

yug_2_desc;Slovenia is also the republic where ideas have the freest course and where debate is most open. Paradoxically, Croatia is ruled by the most conservative Communist elements. This is the enduring aftermath of a purge of party leaders in 1971, when President Tito said he believed Croatian liberalism had come dangerously close to divisive nationalism. Whatever their differences, Slovenia and Croatia have been jointly fighting for greater autonomy. At issue is a bill that would oblige enterprises to turn over their foreign-currency earnings to the National Bank. The Yugoslav Government introduced the bill under urging from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and Croatia and Slovenia blocked its adoption earlier this year. With a hard-currency debt of $20 billion, Yugoslavia can ill afford to disregard pressure from international financial institutions. But for the two republics, control over their foreign-exchange earnings is an absolute prerequisite of continued success, not only for themselves but also for Yugoslavia. Together, Slovenia and Croatia account for 70 percent of the nation's hard-currency receipts. About 60 percent of these earnings go to the national budget, which provides subsidies for the less developed South. Slovenian intellectuals attribute their republic's special status to historical and cultural factors. While the rest of Yugoslavia was part of the Ottoman Empire, the northern areas were governed by Austria-Hungary until 1918. The northern Yugoslavs are Roman Catholic, not Serbian Orthodox or Muslim. Whatever separatist feelings have been aroused by Slovenia's distinctness, they have little currency. But Slovenes and Croats vigorously advocate a Yugoslav version of states' rights against Belgrade as the best way of safeguarding Yugoslavia's future. ''Divided we stand, united we fall,'' a Ljubljana intellectual said.;;;;;;;;;;X
yug_1;North-South Differences;;;;;;;;;;X
yug_1_desc;This country, a leader in the group of 77 nations that demands a ''new international economic order'' on behalf of the developing countries, has a north-south problem of its own. The republics of Slovenia and Croatia are the developed north, and people there say they feel that their less developed brothers are milking them. The feeling is most outspoken in the capital of Slovenia, the republic with the highest living levels. Because jealousies among the Yugoslav republics make standard-of-living comparisons political dynamite, only estimates are given. Stanislav Valant, executive vice president of Ljubljanska Banka, said Slovenia was 50 percent or more above the national average, and Croatia 10 to 15 percent. Slovenia's per capita gross product is six times greater than that of Kosovo, the Albanian-minority region in the south. With 8 percent of the population, Slovenia accounts for 16 to 18 percent of all goods and services produced in Yugoslavia.

warsaw_pact_dissolution;Dissolution of The Warsaw Pact;;;;;;;;;;X
warsaw_pact_dissolution_desc;On February 25, 1991, the foreign and defense ministers of the countries of the Warsaw Treaty Organization met to close down the pact. If this momentous event passed with relatively little comment in the world, it was because events of the last year had made dissolution of the Warsaw Pact inevitable. Founded in May 1955, ostensibly in response to the inclusion of the Federal Republic of Germany in the NATO Alliance, the pact's original signers had been USSR, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and Albania (Albania withdrew in 1968). The forces of the Warsaw Pact would eventually combine tremendous offensive and defensive capabilities embodied most powerfully by massive tank and artillery formations. Positioned north to south along the border of the imaginary Iron Curtain, Warsaw Pact troops stared across at their NATO counterparts, concentrated along the ugly scar that divided Germany into East and West. Yet ironically, the only invasions ever launched by the Warsaw Pact were directed against its own members, Hungary in 1956, and Czechoslovakia in 1968.;;;;;;;;;;X
warsaw_pact_dissolution_1_desc;The Warsaw Pact crumbled for a number of reasons. Serving as a prop for the unpopular Communist regimes of Eastern Europe, and enjoying little to no popular support in those countries, the treaties became increasingly obsolete once non-Communists came to power. Although Soviet authorities showed some tenacity in insisting on maintaining the treaty, it was clear that the greatest hostilities animating the organization were internal. Certainly the countries of Eastern Europe feared attack from the Soviet Union above all. Eventually even the Soviet leadership abandon the pact, prompted by economic difficulties brought on by the inability of a tottering economy to carry the burden of excessive military expenditures. Furthermore, a new brand of strategic international thinking pioneered by Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze came to the conclusion that Eastern Europe had become a liability. There was no longer any socialism to defend.;;;;;;;;;;X
france_nato;France and  NATO;;;;;;;;;;X
france_nato_desc;NATO's unity was breached early in its history with a crisis occurring during Charles de Gaulle's presidency of France. De Gaulle protested the United States' strong role in the organization and what he perceived as a special relationship between it and the United Kingdom. In a memorandum sent to President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Prime Minister Harold Macmillan on 17 September 1958, he argued for the creation of a tripartite directorate that would put France on an equal footing with the US and the UK. Considering the response he received to his memorandum unsatisfactory, de Gaulle began constructing an independent defence force for his country. He wanted to give France, in the event of an East German incursion into West Germany, the option of coming to a separate peace with the Eastern bloc instead of being drawn into a larger NATO-Warsaw Pact war. In February 1959, France withdrew its Mediterranean Fleet from NATO command, and later banned the stationing of foreign nuclear weapons on French soil. This caused the United States to transfer two hundred military aircraft out of France and return control of the air force bases that had operated in France since 1950 to the French by 1967. Though France showed solidarity with the rest of NATO during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, de Gaulle continued his pursuit of an independent defence by removing France's Atlantic and Channel fleets from NATO command. In 1966, all French armed forces were removed from NATO's integrated military command, and all non-French NATO troops were asked to leave France. U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk was later quoted as asking de Gaulle whether his order included ''the bodies of American soldiers in France's cemeteries?'' This withdrawal forced the relocation of SHAPE from Rocquencourt, near Paris, to Casteau, north of Mons, Belgium, by 16 October 1967. France remained a member of the alliance, and committed to the defence of Europe from possible Warsaw Pact attack with its own forces stationed in the Federal Republic of Germany throughout the Cold War. A series of secret accords between US and French officials, the Lemnitzer-Ailleret Agreements, detailed how French forces would dovetail back into NATO's command structure should East-West hostilities break out.;;;;;;;;;;X

The fighting ended on 27 July 1953, when an armistice was signed. The agreement created the Korean Demilitarized Zone to separate North and South Korea, and allowed the return of prisoners. However, no peace treaty has been signed, and the two Koreas are technically still at war.

german_reunification_desc;In September, after some negotiations which involved the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and the United Kingdom, conditions for German reunification were agreed on, with the Allies of World War II renouncing their former rights in Germany and agreeing to remove all occupying troops by 1994. In separate negotiations between Gorbachev and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, it was agreed that a reunified Germany would be free to choose whatever alliance it wanted, though Kohl made no secret that a reunified Germany would remain as part of NATO and the European Community. With the 12 September signing of the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany, Germany became fully sovereign once more from March 15, 1991. On October 3, 1990, East Germany formally ceased to exist. The five recreated states in its former territory acceded to the Federal Republic, while East and West Berlin reunited to form the third city-state of the Federal Republic. Thus the East German population was the first from the Eastern Bloc to join the EC as a part of the reunified Federal Republic of Germany.;;;;;;;;;;X
2+4_agreement;The Two Plus Four Agreement;;;;;;;;;;X
2+4_agreement_desc;The Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany was signed in Moscow, USSR, on 12 September 1990. Under the terms of the treaty, the Four Powers renounced all rights they formerly held in Germany, including in regard to the city of Berlin. As a result, the united Germany would become fully sovereign on 15 March 1991, with Berlin as its capital. It would be free to make and belong to alliances, and without any foreign influence in its politics. Germany was to limit its combined armed forces to no more than 370,000 personnel, no more than 345,000 of whom were to be in the Army and the Air Force. Germany also reaffirmed its renunciation of the manufacture, possession of, and control over nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, and in particular, that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty would continue to apply in full to the unified Germany. No foreign armed forces, nuclear weapons, or the carriers for nuclear weapons would be stationed or deployed in six states (the area of Berlin and the former East Germany), making them a permanent Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone. Germany also agreed to use military force only in accordance with the United Nations Charter. Another of the treaty's important provisions was Germany's confirmation of the by now internationally recognized border with Poland, and other territorial changes in Germany that had taken place since 1945, preventing any future claims to lost territory east of the Oder-Neisse line which had historically been part of Germany for centuries before 31 December 1937. The treaty defined the territory of a 'united Germany' as being the territory of East and West Germany, prohibiting Germany from making any future territorial claims. Germany also agreed to sign a separate treaty with Poland reaffirming the present common border, binding under international law, effectively relinquishing these territories to Poland. In addition, Germany agreed to pay about 55 billion deutschmarks to the Soviet Union in gifts and loans, the equivalent of eight days of the West German GDP.;;;;;;;;;;X
reunification_fear;The German Dread;;;;;;;;;;X
reunification_fear_desc;For decades, Germany's allies had stated their support for reunification, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who speculated that a country that ''decided to kill millions of Jewish people'' in the Holocaust ''will try to do it again'', was one of the few world leaders to publicly oppose it. As reunification became a realistic possibility, however, significant NATO and European opposition emerged in private. A poll of four countries in January 1990 found that a majority of surveyed Americans and French supported reunification, while British and Poles were more divided. 69 percent of Poles and 50 percent of French and British stated that they worried about a reunified Germany becoming ''the dominant power in Europe''. Those surveyed stated several concerns, including Germany again attempting to expand its territory, a revival of Nazism, and the German economy becoming too powerful. While Britons, French and Americans favored Germany remaining a member of NATO, a majority of Poles supported neutrality for the reunified nation. Before the fall of the Berlin Wall, Margaret Thatcher told Mikhail Gorbachev that neither the United Kingdom nor Western Europe wanted the reunification of Germany. Thatcher also clarified that she wanted the Soviet leader to do what he could to stop it, telling Gorbachev ''We do not want a united Germany''. Although she welcomed East German democracy, Thatcher worried that a rapid reunification might weaken Gorbachev, and favoured Soviet troops staying in East Germany as long as possible to act as a counterweight to a united Germany. Thatcher, who carried in her handbag a map of Germany's 1937 borders to show others the ''German problem'', feared that its ''national character'', size and central location in Europe would cause the nation to be a ''destabilizing rather than a stabilizing force in Europe''.;;;;;;;;;;X
reunification_fear_1_desc;In December 1989, she warned fellow European Community leaders at a Strasbourg summit that Kohl attended, ''We defeated the Germans twice! And now they're back!'' Although Thatcher had stated her support for German self-determination in 1985, she now argued that Germany's allies had only supported reunification because they had not believed it would ever happen. Thatcher favoured a transition period of five years for reunification, during which the two Germanies would remain separate states. Although she gradually softened her opposition, as late as March 1990 Thatcher summoned historians and diplomats to a seminar at Chequers to ask ''How dangerous are the Germans?'' and the French ambassador in London reported that Thatcher had told him, ''France and Great Britain should pull together today in the face of the German threat.'' The pace of events surprised the French, whose Foreign Ministry had concluded in October 1989 that reunification ''does not appear realistic at this moment''.;;;;;;;;;;X
reunification_fear_2_desc;A representative of French President François Mitterrand reportedly told an aide to Gorbachev, ''France by no means wants German reunification, although it realises that in the end it is inevitable.'' At the Strasbourg summit, Mitterrand and Thatcher discussed the fluidity of Germany's historical borders. On 20 January 1990, Mitterrand told Thatcher that a unified Germany could ''make more ground than even Hitler had''. He predicted that ''bad'' Germans would reemerge, who might seek to regain former German territory lost after World War II and would likely dominate Hungary, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, leaving ''only Romania and Bulgaria for the rest of us''. The two leaders saw no way to prevent reunification, however, as ''None of us was going to declare war on Germany''. Mitterrand recognized before Thatcher that reunification was inevitable and adjusted his views accordingly, unlike her, he was hopeful that participation in a single currency and other European institutions could control a united Germany. Mitterrand still wanted Thatcher to publicly oppose unification, however, to obtain more concessions from Germany.;;;;;;;;;;X

reunification_treaty_desc;The Volkskammer, the Parliament of East Germany, passed a resolution on 23 August 1990 seeking the accession of the German Democratic Republic to the Federal Republic of Germany as allowed by article 23 of the West German Basic Law. In the wake of that resolution, the ''German reunification treaty'' that had been negotiated between the two German states since 2 July 1990, was signed on 31 August 1990. This Treaty was approved by large majorities in the legislative chambers of both countries on 20 September 1990 (442–47 in the West German Bundestag and 299–80 in the East German Volkskammer). The amendments to the Federal Republic's Basic Law that were foreseen in the Unification Treaty or necessary for its implementation were adopted by the Federal Statute of 23 September 1990. Under article 45 of the Treaty, it entered into force in international Law on 29 September 1990, upon the exchange of notices regarding the completion of the respective internal constitutional requirements for the adoption of the treaty in both East Germany and West Germany.;;;;;;;;;;X
reunification_process;Reunification Process;;;;;;;;;;X
reunification_process_desc;Although there were some small attempts to create a non-socialist East Germany, these were soon overwhelmed by calls for reunification with West Germany. Initially, no timetable was proposed. However, events rapidly came to a head in early 1990. First, in March, the Party of Democratic Socialism—the former Socialist Unity Party of Germany—was heavily defeated in East Germany's first free elections. A grand coalition was formed under Lothar de Maizière, leader of the East German wing of Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, on a platform of speedy reunification. Second, East Germany's economy and infrastructure underwent a swift and near-total collapse. While East Germany had long been reckoned as having the most robust economy in the Soviet bloc, the removal of Communist hegemony revealed the ramshackle foundations of that system. The East German mark had been practically worthless outside of East Germany for some time before the events of 1989–90, further magnifying the problem. Discussions immediately began for an emergency merger of the German economies. On 18 May 1990, the two German states signed a treaty agreeing on monetary, economic and social union. The Treaty Establishing a Monetary, Economic and Social Union between East and West Germany came into force on 1 July 1990, with the Deutsche Mark replacing the East German mark as the official currency of East Germany. The Deutsche Mark had a very high reputation among the East Germans and was considered stable. While the GDR transferred its financial policy sovereignty to West Germany, the West started granting subsidies for the GDR budget and social security system. At the same time many West German laws came into force in the GDR. This created a suitable framework for a political union by diminishing the huge gap between the two existing political, social, and economic systems.;;;;;;;;;;X

East Germany has announced that, starting immediately, its borders are open to everyone. The GDR is opening its borders ... the gates in the Berlin Wall stand open.'' After hearing the broadcast, East Germans began gathering at the wall and at the six checkpoints between East and West, demanding that border guards immediately open the gates. The surprised and overwhelmed guards made many hectic telephone calls to their superiors about the problem. At first, they were ordered to find the ''more aggressive'' people gathered at the gates and stamp their passports with a special stamp that barred them from returning to East Germany—in effect, revoking their citizenship. However, this still left thousands of people demanding to be let through ''as Schabowski said we can.'' It soon became clear that no one among the East German authorities would take personal responsibility for issuing orders to use lethal force, so the vastly outnumbered soldiers had no way to hold back the huge crowd of East German citizens. Finally, at 10:45 pm, the guards yielded, opening the checkpoints and allowing people through with little or no identity checking. As the Ossis swarmed through, they were greeted by Wessis waiting with flowers and champagne amid wild rejoicing. Soon afterward, a crowd of West Berliners jumped on top of the wall, and were soon joined by East German youngsters. They danced together to celebrate their new freedom.;;;;;;;;;;X

ddr_turning_point_desc;Meanwhile, the wave of refugees leaving East Germany for the West had increased and had found its way through Hungary via Czechoslovakia (or via the West German Embassy in Prague), tolerated by the new Krenz government and in agreement with the communist Czechoslovak government. To ease the complications, the politburo led by Krenz decided on 9 November to allow refugees to exit directly through crossing points between East Germany and West Germany, including West Berlin. On the same day, the ministerial administration modified the proposal to include private travel. The new regulations were to take effect the next day. Günter Schabowski, the party boss in East Berlin and the spokesman for the SED Politburo, had the task of announcing this, however, he had not been involved in the discussions about the new regulations and had not been fully updated. Shortly before a press conference on 9 November, he was handed a note announcing the changes, but given no further instructions on how to handle the information. These regulations had only been completed a few hours earlier and were to take effect the following day, so as to allow time to inform the border guards—however, nobody had informed Schabowski. When a reporter asked when the regulations were to take effect, Schabowski assumed they were already in force and replied, ''As far as I know ... immediately, without delay.'' Excerpts from Schabowski's press conference were the lead story on West Germany's two main news programs that night, this, of course, meant that the news was broadcast to nearly all of East Germany as well.;;;;;;;;;;X

ddr_alexanderplatz_demonstration_desc;On 4 November the authorities decided to authorize a demonstration in Berlin and were faced with the Alexanderplatz demonstration where half a million citizens converged on the capital demanding freedom in the biggest protest the GDR ever witnessed. The demonstration was organized by actors and employees of theaters in East Berlin. It was the first demonstration in East German history that was organized by private individuals and was permitted to take place by the authorities. The speakers during the demonstration were members of the opposition, representatives of the regime and artists, and included the dissidents Marianne Birthler and Jens Reich, the writer Stefan Heym, the actor Ulrich Mühe, the head of the East German foreign intelligence service Markus Wolf and Politburo member Günter Schabowski. Thousands of banners showed the slogans that were already used by hundred of thousands of protesters in other East German cities during the still illegal Monday demonstrations. Neither the opening of the Berlin wall nor a possible German reunification were among the demands. Instead the protesters concentrated on the democratization of East Germany, with references to paragraphs 27 and 28 of the East German constitution which in theory but not in practice guaranteed freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. The opening speeches were held by Marion van de Kamp, Johanna Schall, Ulrich Mühe and Jan Josef Liefers, who were stage actors from East Berlin. Ulrich Mühe, actor at the Deutsches Theater demanded in his speech the abolition of the first paragraph of the East German constitution which guaranteed the leading role of the Socialist Unity Party. In the next three hours a series of speakers voiced their demands for democratic reforms in East Germany. The three-hour-long demonstration was televised live on East German television, including the scenes of representatives of the regime being jeered and booed by the protesters.;;;;;;;;;;X

Although he was almost as detested as Honecker himself, he made promises to open up the regime from above. Few East Germans were convinced, however, the demonstrations kept growing – on Monday 23 October the Leipzig protesters numbered 300,000 and remained as large the following week.. Additionally, people continued to flee to West Germany in increasing numbers, first through Hungary and later through Czechoslovakia. At one point, several schools had to close because there were not enough students or teachers to have classes.;;;;;;;;;;X

ddr_fall_of_honecker_desc;After a crisis meeting of the Politburo on 10–11 October 1989, Honecker's planned state visit to Denmark was cancelled and, despite his resistance, at the insistence of the regime's number-two man, Egon Krenz, a public statement was issued that called for ''suggestions for attractive socialism''. Over the following days Krenz worked to secure himself the support of the military and the Stasi and arranged a meeting between Gorbachev and Politburo member Harry Tisch, who was in Moscow, to inform the Kremlin about the now-planned removal of Honecker, Gorbachev reportedly wished them good luck. The sitting of the SED Central Committee planned for the end of November 1989 was pulled forward a week, with the most urgent item on the agenda now being the composition of the Politburo. Krenz and Mielke attempted by telephone on the night of 16 October to win other Politburo members over to remove Honecker. At the beginning of the session on 17 October, Honecker asked his routine question of ''Are there any suggestions for the agenda?'' Stoph replied, ''Please, General Secretary, Erich, I propose that a new item be placed on the agenda. It is the release of Erich Honecker as General Secretary and the election of Egon Krenz in his place.'' Honecker reportedly calmly responded: ''Well, then I open the debate''. All those present then spoke, in turn, but none in favour of Honecker. Günter Schabowski even extended the dismissal of Honecker to also include his posts in the State Council and as Chairman of the National Defence Council while childhood friend Günter Mittag moved away from Honecker. Mielke supposedly blamed Honecker for almost all the country’s current ills and threatened to publish compromising information that he possessed, if Honecker refused to resign. After three hours the Politburo voted to remove Honecker. In accordance with longstanding practice, Honecker voted for his own removal. Publicly, the decision was announced that: ''the Central Committee has obliged the request of Erich Honecker to release him from the post of General Secretary, from the Office of State Council Chairman and the post of Chairman of the National Defence Council due to health reasons''. Krenz was unanimously voted in his successor as General Secretary.;;;;;;;;;;X

ddr_we_are_the_people_desc;By 9 October 1989, just after the 40th anniversary celebrations of the GDR, what had begun as a few hundred gatherers at the Nikolaikirche had swelled to more than 70,000 (out of the city's population of 500,000), all united in peaceful opposition to the regime. The most famous chant became Wir sind das Volk! (''We are the people!''), reminding their leaders that a democratic republic has to be ruled by the people, not by an undemocratic party claiming to represent them. Although some demonstrators were arrested, the threat of large-scale intervention by security forces never materialised as local leaders, without precise orders from East Berlin and surprised by the unexpectedly high number of citizens, shied away from causing a possible massacre, ordering the retreat of their forces. Later, Egon Krenz claimed it was he who gave the order not to intervene. The next week, in Leipzig on 16 October 1989, 120,000 showed up, with military units again being held on stand-by in the vicinity. The next week, the number more than doubled to 320,000.;;;;;;;;;;X
ddr_anniversary;40th Anniversary of the German Democratic Republic;;;;;;;;;;X
ddr_anniversary_desc;On 6 and 7 October, Mikhail Gorbachev visited East Germany to mark the 40th anniversary of the German Democratic Republic, and urged the East German leadership to accept reform. A famous quote of his is rendered in German as ''Wer zu spät kommt, den bestraft das Leben'' (He who is too late is punished by life). However, Honecker remained opposed to internal reform, with his regime even going so far as forbidding the circulation of Soviet publications that it viewed as subversive. Virtually ignoring the problems facing the country, Honecker and the rest of the Politburo celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Republic in East Berlin on October 7. As in past celebrations, soldiers marched on parade and missiles were displayed on large trucks to showcase the Republic's weaponry. However, the parade proved to be a harbinger. With Mikhail Gorbachev and most of the Warsaw Pact leaders in attendance, members of the FDJ were heard chanting, ''Gorby, help us! Gorby, save us!'' That same night, the first of many large demonstrations occurred in East Berlin, the first mass demonstration in the capital itself. Similar demonstrations for freedom of speech and of the press erupted across the country and increased pressure on the regime to reform.;;;;;;;;;;X

ddr_monday_demonstrations_desc;In Leipzig the demonstrations began on 4 September 1989 after the weekly Friedensgebet (prayer for peace) in the Nikolaikirche with parson Christian Führer, and eventually filled the nearby downtown Karl Marx Square. Safe in the knowledge that the Lutheran Church supported their resistance, many dissatisfied East German citizens gathered in the court of the church, and non-violent demonstrations began in order to demand rights such as the freedom to travel to foreign countries and to elect a democratic government. Informed by West German television and friends about the events, people in other East German cities began repeating the Leipzig demonstration, meeting at city squares on Monday evenings.;;;;;;;;;;X
ddr_monday_demonstrations_2_desc;After the fifth successive Monday demonstration in Leipzig on 2 October attracted 10,000 protesters, Socialist Unity Party (SED) leader Erich Honecker issued a shoot and kill order to the military.

bulgaria_8_desc;Constitutional Assembly elections were held in Bulgaria on 10 June 1990, with a second round for eighteen seats on 17 June. They were the first elections held since the fall of Communism the previous winter, and the first free national elections since 1931. The elections were held to elect the 7th Grand National Assembly, tasked with adopting a new (democratic) constitution. The new electoral system was changed from 400 single-member constituencies used during the Communist-era to a split system whereby half were elected in single member constituencies and half by proportional representation. The result was a victory for the Bulgarian Socialist Party, the freshly renamed Communist Party, which won 211 of the 400 seats. Voter turnout was 90.3 percent, the highest on record.;;;;;;;;;;X

This swift move, however, gained only a short respite for the Communist Party and prevented revolutionary change. Mladenov promised to open up the regime, even going as far as to say that he supported free elections. However, demonstrations throughout the country brought the situation to a head. On December 11, Mladenov went on national television to announce the Communist Party had abandoned power.;;;;;;;;;;X

Dzhurov met Zhivkov in private and told him that he needed to resign, and there was enough support on the Politburo to vote him out. Zhivkov was taken by surprise and tried to marshal support, to no avail. An hour before the next day's meeting, Dzhurov gave Zhivkov an ultimatum—unless he resigned, the Politburo would not only vote to oust him, but have him arrested and executed. Seeing the writing on the wall, after the motion calling for his removal passed, Zhivkov resigned, officially for reasons of age and health. Mladenov was named the new party leader.;;;;;;;;;;X
bulgaria_5;Unrest in Bulgaria;;;;;;;;;;X
bulgaria_5_desc;By the time the impact of Mikhail Gorbachev's reform program in the Soviet Union was felt in Bulgaria in the late 1980s, the Communists, like their leader, had grown too feeble to resist the demand for change for long.

bulgaria_4_desc;In October 1989, Mladenov organised a CSCE environmental summit in Sofia. He invited an independent group of Bulgarian environmental activists, Ecoglasnost, to participate. Ten days into the conference, several Ecoglasnost activists and supporters were brutally beaten up by CSS and militia officers—on orders from Zhivkov. They then collared 36 other opposition activists, drove them to the countryside and forced them to walk back to Sofia. Amid near-unanimous international condemnation, Mladenov, Lukanov and Atansov decided that Zhivkov had to go. In a critical step, they convinced Defence Minister Dobri Dzhurov to support them.;;;;;;;;;;X
bulgaria_3;The Revival Process Results;;;;;;;;;;X
bulgaria_3_desc;An assimilation campaign of the late 1980s directed against ethnic Turks resulted in the emigration of some 300,000 Bulgarian Turks to Turkey, which caused a significant drop in agricultural production due to the loss of labor force. As it turned out, this was the beginning of the end for the longtime leader. Bulgaria was the target of near-unanimous condemnation from the international community, even the Soviets protested. Gorbachev already did not think much of Zhivkov, he had lumped Zhivkov in with a group of inflexible hardliners that included East Germany's Erich Honecker, Czechoslovakia's Gustáv Husák and Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu. However, after the Turkish episode, he was determined to see Zhivkov gone. The Turkish affair also alarmed several high-ranking Bulgarian officials as well, including Prime Minister Georgi Atanasov, Foreign Minister Petar Mladenov and Finance Minister Andrey Lukanov. They began plotting to remove him, but had to move discreetly given the ubiquity of the CSS.;;;;;;;;;;X
bulgaria_2;The Revival Process - Open Borders;;;;;;;;;;X
bulgaria_2_desc;In December 1984, Todor Zhivkov began a campaign of forceful assimilation of Bulgaria's Turkish minority, most notably forcing all Turks to take Bulgarian names. By 1989, resistance to this policy led to riots, which resulted in multiple deaths. In May 1989, Zhivkov suddenly granted permission of all Turks to leave the country, which led to over 300.000 emigrating to Turkey within three months.;;;;;;;;;;X
bulgaria_1.5;Prime Minister Grisha Filipov;;;;;;;;;;X
bulgaria_1.5_desc;Filipov was very close to Todor Zhivkov and was regularly touted as a potential successor. A leading member of the Politburo, he formed the 77th Bulgarian government on 16 June 1981 following elections to the National Assembly. He held the post until 21 March 1986 when Zhivkov replaced him with Georgi Atanasov. The move, which took place against the backdrop of reforms being brought in by Mikhail Gorbachev, was characterised as a cosmetic gesture aimed to create the illusion of change rather than a Bulgarian version of glasnost and perestroika.;;;;;;;;;;X
bulgaria_1;The Bulgarian Perestroika;;;;;;;;;;X
bulgaria_1_desc;When Mikhail Gorbachev announced his reform program, Zhivkov made a show of copying it, believing that Gorbachev wasn't really serious about glasnost or perestroika. However, he showed his true colors when he expelled several members of a human-rights watch group from the Party. Soon afterward, when several intellectuals announced the formation of the ''Club for the Support of Perestroika and Glasnost,'' he arrested the leaders and threw them out of the Party.;;;;;;;;;;X
bulgaria;The Revival Process;;;;;;;;;;X
bulgaria_desc;The Revival Process, also known as the Process of Rebirth was the official name of the forceful assimilation of Bulgaria's Turkish minority (900,000 people or 10 percent of the population) to assimilate by changing their Turkish names to Bulgarian names. It was enacted between 1985—1989 under the communist government of Todor Zhivkov. Those who refused were exiled to Turkey. In 1984, as part of a policy of Bulgarisation, all Bulgarian nationals who were ethnically Turkish were forced to exchange their names for Bulgarian names amid much official intimidation, some violence and loss of life (Muslim Bulgarians had been forced to change their names in 1972).;;;;;;;;;;X
romania_12;The Ceausescus Trial and Execution;;;;;;;;;;X
romania_12_desc;On 24 December, Ion Iliescu, head of the newly formed Council of the National Salvation Front signed a Decree on the establishment of the Extraordinary Military Tribunal, a drumhead court-martial to try the Ceausescus. In a short show trial on Christmas day 1989, a military prosecutor accused the Ceausescus of ''genocide'' against their own people, arguing that their disastrous policies had led to starvation, poverty, and regular electricity and heating outages. Worse though, he added, was their crime of ''suppressing the soul of the nation,'' a reference to the dreaded Securitate secret police.  During the trial there was considerable concern that forces sympathetic to the old regime might try to rescue the Ceausescus. The trial was held on 25 December, lasted for about 2 hours, and delivered death sentences to the couple. Although nominally the Ceausescus had a right of appeal, their execution followed immediately, on the spot, being carried out by three paratroopers with their service rifles. TV footage showed the couple pleading to be shot together as they were led out of the court room with their hands tied behind their back. Their bloodied bodies were shown on TV after the firing squad had done its work but the actual execution took place so quickly that the cameraman failed to film the moment they were actually shot.;;;;;;;;;;X

They didn't know it, but they were only a few meters from Ceausescu. The elevator's electricity failed just before it reached the top floor, and Ceausescu's bodyguards forced it open and ushered the couple onto the roof. Ceasescu and his wife escaped by helicopter, an aide held a gun to the pilot's head. Below in Palace Square almost 100,000 people had gathered and were now singing deliriously to the tune of a widely-known English soccer hymn: ''Ole! Ole! Ole! Ceausescu nu mai e!'' (''Ole! Ole! Ole! Ceausescu is no more!'').;;;;;;;;;;X
romania_9;Stanculescu's Choice;;;;;;;;;;X
romania_9_desc;At approximately 09:30 on the morning of 22 December, Vasile Milea, Ceausescu's minister of defense, died under suspicious circumstances. A communiqué by Ceausescu stated that Milea had been sacked for treason, and that he had committed suicide after his treason was revealed. The most widespread opinion at the time was that Milea hesitated to follow Ceausescu's orders to fire on the demonstrators, even though tanks had been dispatched to downtown Bucharest that morning. Milea was already in severe disfavour with Ceausescu for initially sending soldiers to Timisoara without live ammunition. The rank-and-file soldiers believed that Milea had actually been murdered, and went over virtually en masse to the revolution. The senior commanders wrote off Ceausescu as a lost cause and made no effort to keep their men loyal to the regime. For all intents and purposes, this ended any chance of Ceausescu staying in power.;;;;;;;;;;X
romania_8;The Romanian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;X
romania_8_desc;As he was addressing the crowd from the balcony of the Central Committee building, sudden movement came from the outskirts of the massed assembly, as did the sound of fireworks, bombs, or guns, which together caused the assembly to break into chaos. Initially frightened, the crowds tried to disperse. Bullhorns then began to spread the news that the Securitate was firing on the crowd and that a ''revolution'' was unfolding. This persuaded people in the assembly to join in. The rally turned into a protest demonstration. The entire speech was being broadcast live around Romania, and it is estimated that perhaps 76 percent of the nation was watching. Censors attempted to cut the live video feed, and replace it with Communist propaganda songs and video praising the Ceausescu regime, but parts of the riots had already been broadcast and most of the Romanian people realized that something unusual was in progress. Ceausescu and his wife, as well as other officials and CPEx members, panicked, and Ceausescu's bodyguard hustled him back inside the building. The jeers and whistles soon erupted into riot, the crowd took to the streets, placing the capital, like Timisoara, in turmoil. Members of the crowd spontaneously began shouting anti-Ceausescu slogans, which spread and became chants: ''Jos dictatorul!'' (''Down with the dictator''), ''Moarte criminalului!'' (''Death to the criminal''), ''Noi suntem poporul, jos cu dictatorul!'' (''We are the People, down with the dictator''), ''Ceausescu cine esti?/Criminal din Scornicesti'' (''Ceausescu, who are you? A criminal from Scornicesti'').;;;;;;;;;;X
romania_8-1_desc;As the hours passed, many more people took to the streets. Had Ceausescu been willing to talk, he might have been able to salvage something. Instead, he decided on force. Soon the protesters – unarmed and unorganized – were confronted by soldiers, tanks, TABs, USLA troops (anti-terrorist special squads), and armed plain-clothes Securitate officers. The crowd was soon being shot at from various buildings, side streets, and tanks. Firefighters hit the demonstrators with powerful water jets and the police continued to beat and arrest people. Protesters managed to build a defensible barricade in front of the Dunarea restaurant, which stood until after midnight, but was finally torn apart by government forces. Intense continuous shooting continued until after 03:00, by which time the survivors had fled the streets. The fighting continued throughout the night. Upon learning of Milea's death, Ceausescu appointed Victor Stanculescu as minister of defense. He accepted after a brief hesitation. Stanculescu, however, ordered the troops back to their quarters without Ceausescu's knowledge, and moreover persuaded Ceausescu to leave by helicopter, thus making the dictator a fugitive. At that same moment, angry protesters began storming the Communist Party headquarters, Stanculescu and the soldiers under his command did not oppose them. By refusing to carry out Ceausescu's orders, Stanculescu played a central role in the overthrow of the dictatorship. ''I had the prospect of two execution squads: Ceausescu's and the revolutionary one!'' confessed Stanculescu later. In the afternoon, Stanculescu ''chose'' Ion Iliescu's political group from among others that were striving for power in the aftermath of the recent events.;;;;;;;;;;X
romania_7;Ceausescu's Speech;;;;;;;;;;X
romania_7_desc;On the morning of 21 December Ceausescu addressed an assembly of approximately 100,000 people, to condemn the uprising in Timisoara. Party officials took great pains to make it appear that Ceausescu was still immensely popular. Several busloads of workers, under threat of being fired, arrived in Bucharest's Piata Palatului and were given red flags, banners and large pictures of Ceausescu. They were augmented by several bystanders who were rounded up on Calea Victoriei. In a speech laden with the usual Marxist–Leninist ''wooden language'', spurting out pro-socialist and Communist Party rhetoric, Ceausescu delivered a litany of the achievements of the ''socialist revolution'' and Romanian ''multi-laterally developed socialist society''. He blamed the Timisoara uprising on ''fascist agitators.'' However, Ceausescu was out of touch with his people and completely misread the crowd's mood. The people remained unresponsive, and only the front rows supported Ceausescu with cheers and applause. Eight minutes into the speech, some in the crowd actually began to jeer, boo, whistle and utter insults at him—a reaction considered unthinkable for most of Ceausescu's rule. Workers from a Bucharest power plant started chanting ''Ti-mi-soa-ra! Ti-mi-soa-ra!''—a chant that was soon picked up by others in the crowd. In response, Ceausescu raised his right hand in hopes of silencing the crowd, but his stunned expression encouraged them even more. He then tried to placate the crowd by offering to raise workers' salaries by 100 lei per month (about 9 U.S. dollars at the time, yet a 5–10 percent raise for a modest salary) and student scholarships from 100 to 110 lei while continuing to praise the achievements of the Socialist Revolution. However, a revolution was brewing right in front of his eyes.;;;;;;;;;;X
romania_6;The Crackdown;;;;;;;;;;X
romania_6_desc;Riots and protests resumed the following day, 17 December. The rioters broke into the District Committee building and threw Party documents, propaganda brochures, Ceausescu's writings, and other symbols of communist power out of the windows. Again, the protesters attempted to set the building on fire, but this time they were stopped by military units. Since Romania did not have riot police (Ceausescu, who genuinely believed that the Romanian people loved him, never saw the need for them), the military were sent in to control the riots because the situation was too large for the Securitate and conventional police to handle. The significance of the army presence in the streets was an ominous one: it meant that they had received their orders from the highest level of the command chain, presumably from Ceausescu himself. The army failed to establish order and chaos ensued with gunfire, fights, casualties, and burned cars. Transportor Amfibiu Blindat (TAB) armored personnel carriers and tanks were called in. After 20:00, from Piata Libertatii (Liberty Square) to the Opera there was wild shooting, including the area of Decebal bridge, Calea Lipovei (Lipovei Avenue), and Calea Girocului (Girocului Avenue). Tanks, trucks, and TABs blocked the accesses into the city while helicopters hovered overhead. After midnight the protests calmed down. Ion Coman, Ilie Matei, and Stefan Gusa (Chief of the Romanian General Staff) inspected the city, in which some areas looked like the aftermath of a war - destruction, ash, and blood. Security forces shot down 73 men and women.;;;;;;;;;;X
romania_6-1_desc;The morning of 18 December the centre was being guarded by soldiers and Securitate agents in plainclothes. Mayor Mot ordered a Party gathering to take place at the University, with the purpose of condemning the ''vandalism'' of the previous days. He also declared martial law, prohibiting people from going about in groups of larger than two. Defying the curfew, a group of 30 young men headed for the Orthodox Cathedral, where they stopped and waved a Romanian flag from which they had removed the Romanian Communist coat of arms. Expecting that they would be fired upon, they started to sing ''Desteapta-te, române!'' (''Wake up, Romanian!''), an earlier national song that had been banned since 1947. They were, indeed, fired upon and some died, and others were seriously injured, while the lucky ones were able to escape.;;;;;;;;;;X
romania_6-2_desc;On 19 December, Radu Balan and Stefan Gusa visited the workers in the city’s factories, but failed to get them to resume work. On 20 December massive columns of workers were entering the city. About 100,000 protesters occupied Piata Operei (Opera Square) and started to chant anti-government protests. Meanwhile, Emil Bobu (Secretary to the Central Committee) and Prime Minister Constantin Dascalescu were sent by Elena Ceausescu (Nicolae Ceausescu being at that time in Iran), to solve the situation. They met with a delegation of the protesters and accepted freeing the majority of the arrested protesters. However, they refused to comply with the protesters’ main demand (resignation of Ceausescu), and the situation remained essentially unchanged. The next day, trains loaded with workers originating from factories in Oltenia arrived in Timisoara. The regime was attempting to use them to repress the mass protests, but after a brief encounter they ended up joining the protests. One worker explained: ''Yesterday, our factory boss and a Party official rounded us up in the yard, handed us wooden clubs and told us that Hungarians and ‘hooligans’ were devastating Timisoara and that it is our duty to go there and help crush the riots. But I realized that wasn't the truth.'' Upon Ceausescu's return on the evening of 20 December, the situation became even more tense, and he gave a televised speech from the TV studio inside the Central Committee Building, in which he spoke about the events at Timisoara in terms of an ''interference of foreign forces in Romania's internal affairs'' and an ''external aggression on Romania's sovereignty.'' The country, which had no information about the Timisoara events from the national media, heard about the Timisoara revolt from Western radio stations like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, and by word of mouth.;;;;;;;;;;X
romania_5;The Timisoara Uprising;;;;;;;;;;X
romania_5_desc;On 16 December 1989, a protest broke out on the part of the Hungarian minority in Timisoara in response to an attempt by the government to evict Hungarian Reformed church pastor László Tokés. Tokés had in July of that year made critical comments against the regime's Systematization policy to Hungarian television, and complained that Romanians did not even know their human rights. The government then alleged that he was inciting ethnic hatred. At the behest of the government, his bishop removed him from his post—thereby depriving him of the right to use the apartment to which he was entitled as a pastor—and assigned him to be a pastor in the countryside. For some time, his parishioners gathered around his home to protect him from harassment and eviction. Many passers-by spontaneously joined in. As it became clear that the crowd would not disperse, the mayor, Petre Mot, made remarks suggesting that he had overturned the decision to evict Tokés. Meanwhile, the crowd had grown impatient, and when Mot declined to confirm his statement against the planned eviction in writing, the crowd started to chant anticommunist slogans. Subsequently, police and Securitate forces showed up at the scene. By 19:30, the protest had spread, and the original cause became largely irrelevant. Some of the protesters attempted to burn down the building that housed the District Committee of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR). The Securitate responded with tear gas and water jets, while the police beat up rioters and arrested many of them. Around 21:00, the rioters withdrew. They regrouped eventually around the Romanian Orthodox Cathedral and started a protest march around the city, but again they were confronted by the security forces.;;;;;;;;;;X
romania_4;The Party Congress Protest;;;;;;;;;;X
romania_4_desc;It initially appeared that Ceausescu would weather the wave of revolution sweeping across eastern Europe.

On 11 November 1989, before the party congress, on Bucharest's Brezoianu Street and Kogalniceanu Boulevard, students from Cluj-Napoca and Bucharest demonstrated with placards ''We want Reforms against Ceausescu government.'' The students – including Mihnea Paraschivescu, Gratian Vulpe, and the economist Dan Caprariu-Schlachter from Cluj – were detained and investigated by the Securitate at the Rahova Penitentiary, on suspicion of propaganda against the socialist society. There were other letters and other attempts to draw attention to the economic, cultural, and spiritual oppression of Romanians, but they served only to intensify the activity of the communist police and Securitate.;;;;;;;;;;X

romania_3_desc;In March 1989, several leading activists of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) protested in a letter that criticized the economic policies of Nicolae Ceausescu, but shortly thereafter Ceausescu achieved a significant political victory: Romania paid off its external debt of about US$13 billion several months before the time that even the Romanian dictator expected. However, in the months following the announcement the austerity and the shortage of goods remained the same as before.;;;;;;;;;;X
romania_2;The Letter of Six;;;;;;;;;;X
romania_2_desc;The Letter of the Six was an open letter signed in March 1989 by Silviu Brucan, together with five other Romanian Communist dignitaries. he document, which was immediately broadcast on Radio Free Europe, BBC Radio, and Voice of America, was a left-wing critique of the policies of the president Nicolae Ceausescu, and it led to the swift arrest and interrogation of the signatories by the Securitate (the secret police), and then to their house arrest at various locations. The Securitate depicted Brucan as one of several ''hostile, inveterate, elements'' and ''the agent of foreign imperialist secret services''. Although lacking in actual popular support, the letter was argued to be the among most important and influential acts of opposition during its period, and a notorious break with the tradition of strict obedience and party discipline.;;;;;;;;;;X
romania_1;The Brasov Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;X
romania_1_desc;Beginning in late 1986, as workers throughout this Soviet Bloc country mobilized in protest of communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu's economic policies. Labor uprisings sprouted in the major industrial centers of Cluj-Napoca and Nicolina, Iasi, culminating in a massive strike in Brasov, one of the largest cities in Romania. Ceausescu's draconian economic measures sought to curb food and energy consumption and reduce worker's wages, leading to what Romanian émigré Vladimir Tismaneanu calls an ''all pervasive discontent,'' making Romania ''the Eastern Bloc country most vulnerable to revolution.'' Located in southeastern Transylvania, Brasov was Romania's most industrially developed city, with over 61 percent of labor participating in industry. A skilled working class emerged in the 1960s as the Communist government encouraged migrations from the more rural regions of Romania (such as Moldavia) to operate Brasov factories. Therefore, the industrial decline in Eastern Europe during the mid-1980s hit Brasov and its workers especially hard. Ceausescu's debt reduction plan beginning in 1982 led to the collapse of the consumer market of the city. Money intended for food production and distribution was in turn diverted to debt payment to the West. Therefore, the state rationed key foodstuff and consumer goods, leading to long lines for the most basic commodities. It is in this climate of economic depression and food shortages that the Brasov rebellion erupted on 15 November 1987.;;;;;;;;;;X
romania;Ceausescu and The Systematization;;;;;;;;;;X
romania_desc;In 1981, Ceausescu began an austerity program designed to enable Romania to liquidate its entire national debt ($13 billion). In order to achieve this, many basic goods, including gas, heat and food were rationed, which drastically reduced the standard of living in Romania and increased malnutrition. The infant mortality rate also grew to be the highest in Europe. The secret police (Securitate) had become so ubiquitous as to make Romania essentially a police state. Free speech was limited and opinions that did not favor the Communist Party were forbidden. The large numbers of Securitate informers made organized dissent nearly impossible. The regime deliberately played on this sense that everyone was being watched in order to make it easier to bend the people to the Party's will. Even by Soviet bloc standards, the Securitate was exceptionally brutal. Ceausescu created a cult of personality, with weekly shows in stadiums or on streets in different cities dedicated to him, his wife and the Communist Party. There were several megalomaniac projects, such as the construction of the grandiose House of the Republic, the biggest palace in the world, the adjacent Centrul Civic, and a museum dedicated to communism and Ceausescu. These and similar projects drained the country's finances and aggravated the already embattled economic situation. Thousands of Bucharest residents were evicted from their homes, which were subsequently demolished to make room for the huge structures. The austerity program started in 1981 and the widespread poverty it introduced made the Communist regime very unpopular.;;;;;;;;;;X

Two days later, the legislature formally deleted the sections of the Constitution giving the Communists a monopoly of power. Barbed wire and other obstructions were removed from the border with West Germany and Austria in early December. On December 10, President Gustáv Husák appointed the first largely non-communist government in Czechoslovakia since 1948, and resigned. Alexander Dubcek was elected speaker of the federal parliament on December 28 and Václav Havel the President of Czechoslovakia on December 29, 1989.;;;;;;;;;;X

It took place throughout the country between 12:00 and 14:00, supported by a reported 75 percent of the population. The Ministry of Culture releases anti-Communist literature for public checkouts in libraries, effectively ending decades of censorship. Civic Forum demonstrates its capacity to disrupt the political order and thereby establish itself as the legitimate voice of the nation in negotiations with the state. The civic movements mobilize support for the general strike. On november 29, The Federal Assembly deletes the provision in the constitution referring to the ''leading role'' of the Communist Party, officially ending Communist rule in Czechoslovakia.;;;;;;;;;;X

Czechoslovak TV and Radio announce that they will join the general strike. A discussion with representatives of the opposition is broadcast by the Slovak section of Federal Television. It was the first free discussion on Czechoslovak television since its beginning. As a result, the editorial staff of Slovak newspapers start to join the opposition. On november 25, the new Communist leadership holds a press conference. It includes Miroslav Stepán, while excluding Ladislav Adamec and does not address demonstrators' demands. Later that day, Stepán resigns as Prague Secretary. The number of participants in the regular anti-government demonstration in Prague-Letná reach an estimated 800,000 people. Demonstrations in Bratislava peak at around 100,000 participants. On november 26, Prime Minister Adamec met with Havel for the first time.

Striking students force the representatives of the Slovak government and of the Communist Party of Slovakia to participate in a dialogue, in which the official representatives are immediately put on the defensive. Employees of the Slovak section of the Federal Television require the leaders of the Federal Television to provide true information on the events in the country, otherwise they would initiate a strike of TV employees. Uncensored live reports from demonstrations in Bratislava begin. On november 23, evening news shows factory workers heckling Miroslav Stepán, the Prague Communist Secretary. The military inform the Communist leadership of its readiness to act. The military and the Ministry of Defense were preparing for actions against the opposition. Immediately after the meeting, however, the Minister of Defense delivers a TV address, in which he says that the army would never undertake action against the people and calls for an end to demonstrations.;;;;;;;;;;X

cze_velvet_6_desc;The first official meeting of the Civic Forum with the Prime Minister takes place. The Prime Minister agrees to personally guarantee that no violence would be used against the people, however he would ''protect socialism, about which no discussion is possible''. An organized mass demonstration takes place in Wenceslas Square in central Prague. Actors and students travel to factories inside and outside Prague to gain support for their colleagues in other cities. A mass demonstration erupts in Hviezdoslav Square in downtown Bratislava. The students present demands and ask the people to participate in the general strike planned for Monday, November 27. A separate demonstration demands the release of the political prisoner Ján carnogurský in front of the Palace of Justice. Alexander DubCek addresses this demonstration—his first appearance during the Velvet Revolution. As a result, Carnogurský is released on November 23. Further demonstrations follow in all major cities of Czechoslovakia. Cardinal Frantisek Tomásek, the Catholic primate of the Bohemian lands, declares his support for the students and issues a declaration criticizing the current government's policies. For the first time during the revolution, the ''radical'' demand to abolish the article of the Constitution establishing the ''leading role'' of the Communist Party is expressed by Lubomír Feldek at a meeting of Public Against Violence. In the evening, Milos Jakes, the chairman of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, gives a special address on Federal Television. He says that order must be preserved, that socialism is the only alternative for Czechoslovakia and criticizes protest groups. Government officials, especially the Head of the Communist Party Milos Jakes, keep their hard-line position.

Civic Forum representatives negotiate unofficially with Adamec without Havel. Adamec is sympathetic to the students' demands. However, he is outvoted in a special cabinet meeting the same day. The government, in an official statement, makes no concessions. Civic Forum adds a demand: the abolition of the ''ruling position'' of the Communist Party from the Constitution. Non-Communist newspapers publish information that contradicts the Communist interpretation.

cze_velvet_4_desc;Theatres in Bratislava, Brno, Ostrava and other towns go on strike. Members of artistic and literary associations as well as organizations and institutions join. Members of a civic initiative meet with the Prime Minister, who tells them that he had twice been prohibited from resigning his post and that changes require mass demonstrations like those in East Germany (some 250,000 students). He asks them to keep the number of ''casualties'' during the expected changes to a minimum. About 500 Slovak artists, scientists and leaders meet at the Art Forum in Bratislava at 17:00. They denounce the attack against the students in Prague on November 17 and form the Public Against Violence, which would become the leading force behind the opposition movement in Slovakia. Actors and members of the audience in a Prague theatre, together with Václav Havel and other prominent members of Charter 77 and other dissident organizations, establish the Civic Forum as a mass popular movement for reforms, at 22:00. They call for the dismissal of top officials responsible for the violence, and an independent investigation of the incident and the release of all political prisoners. College students strike. On television, government officials call for peace and a return to the city's normal business. The television airs an interview with Martin Smíd to persuade the public that nobody had been killed, the quality of the recording is low and rumors continue. It would take several more days to confirm that nobody had been killed and, by then, the revolution had gained further momentum. The leaders of the Democratic Initiative present demands: the resignation of the government and the formation of a temporary government composed of noncompromised members of the current government.;;;;;;;;;;X

cze_velvet_3_desc;Two students visit Prime Minister Ladislav Adamec at his private residence and describe to him what had happened at Národní Street. The strike at the Realistic Theatre is declared and other theatres quickly follow. The theatres open their stages only for public discussions. At the initiative of students from the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague, the students in Prague strike. This strike is joined by university students throughout Czechoslovakia. The theatre employees and actors in Prague, support the strike. Instead of playing, actors read a proclamation by the students and artists to the audience, that calls for a general strike on November 27. Home-made posters and proclamations are posted. As all media (radio, TV, newspapers) is strictly controlled by the Communist Party, this was the only way to spread the message. In the evening, Radio Free Europe reported that a student (named as Martin Smíd) was killed by the police during the previous day's demonstration. Although the report was false, it heightened the feeling of crisis, and persuaded some hesitant citizens to overcome their fear and join the protests.;;;;;;;;;;X
cze_velvet_2;The Dead Student Hoax;;;;;;;;;;X
cze_velvet_2_desc;New movements led by Václav Havel surface, invoking the idea of a united society where the state would politically restructure. The Socialist Union of Youth organizes a mass demonstration to commemorate International Students Day and the fiftieth anniversary of the murder of students by the Nazi government. Most members of SSM had privately been in opposition to the Communist leadership, but had been afraid of speaking up for fear of persecution. This demonstration gave average students an opportunity to join others and express their opinions. By 16:00, about 15,000 people had joined the demonstration. They walk to Karel Hynek Mácha's grave at Vysehrad Cemetery and—after the official end of the march—continue into downtown Prague,  carrying banners and chanting anti-Communist slogans. At about 19:30, the demonstrators are stopped by a cordon of riot police at Národní Street. They had blocked all escape routes and attack the students. Once all the protesters disperse, one of the participants—secret police agent Ludvík Zifcák—is lying on the street. Zifcák did not pretend to be dead, he had been overcome by emotion. Policemen carry his motionless body to the medical car. The atmosphere of fear and hopelessness gave birth to the hoax about the dead student. This hoax was made up by Drahomíra Dražská, while she awaited treatment later after she was hurt during the riot. Dražská worked at the college and shared her hoax with several people next day, including the wife of journalist Petr Uhl, the correspondent of Radio Free Europe. This incident mobilised the people and triggered the revolution. That same evening, students and theatre actors agree to go on strike.;;;;;;;;;;X

The Communist Party of Slovakia had expected trouble, and the mere fact that the demonstration was organised was viewed as a problem by the Party. Armed forces were put on alert before the demonstration.

cze_candle_demonstration_desc;The Candle Demonstration on 25 March 1988 in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, was the first mass demonstration since 1969 against the communist regime in Czechoslovakia. The Demonstration was organized by Roman Catholic dissent groups asking for religious freedom in Czechoslovakia. The peaceful Candle Demonstration of five thousand believers was suppressed by the police. The Demonstration was planned by Marián Stastný, Executive Vice-President of the Slovak World Congress and his associate Dr. Paul Arnold of Switzerland. They were in touch with the Carnogurský family of Bratislava and passed on the plans for the demonstration via Stastný's mother-in-law, who was on a visit to Switzerland. Catholic activist Frantisek Miklosko initiated a request for a permit to demonstrate, but his proposal was rejected by the authorities. Information about the event was propagated through Vatican Radio and, after the event, by Radio Free Europe and Voice of America. Five thousand Slovaks protested at Hviezdoslav Square with candles in their hands, and further thousands in adjacent streets, while the main entrance to the square was blocked by the secret police. Police first used water cannons against protesters while they ran their sirens and yelled at protesters to get away from the square, then began attacking the protesters with batons and sticks. Leading Communist officials (e.g. the Slovak prime minister, minister of the interior, minister of culture) were observing the whole ''operation'' from inside the Carlton Hotel on Hviezdoslav square.;;;;;;;;;;X
cze_perestroika;The Czech Perestroika;;;;;;;;;;X
cze_perestroika_desc;The nature of blacklisting changed gradually after the introduction of Mikhail Gorbachev's policies of Glasnost (openness) and Perestroika (restructuring) in 1985. The Czechoslovak Communist leadership verbally supported Perestroika, but made few changes. Speaking about the Prague Spring of 1968 was taboo. The latter part of Husák's tenure saw a struggle within the Politburo over whether to adopt Gorbachev-style reforms. While the hardliners, led by Vasil Bilak, opposed any restructuring, moderates led by Prime Minister Lubomir Strougal strongly favoured reform. Husák himself stayed neutral until April 1987, when he announced a somewhat half-hearted reform program starting in 1991.;;;;;;;;;;X
cze_normalization;The Normalization;;;;;;;;;;X
cze_normalization_desc;When Gustáv Husák became the leader of the KSC instead of Alexander Dubcek in April 1969 after the military intervention of Warsaw Pact armies, his regime acted quickly to ''normalize'' the country's political situation. The chief objectives of Husák's normalization were the restoration of firm party rule and the reestablishment of Czechoslovakia's status as a committed member of the socialist bloc. The method by which KSS under Husák ruled was commonly summed up as ''reluctant terror.'' It involved careful adherence to the Soviet Union's policy objectives and the use of what was perceived as the minimum amount of repression at home necessary to fulfil these objectives and prevent a return to Dubcek-style reformism. Repeated arrests and imprisonment of persons opposing the regime, continued throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s. Less coercive controls, such as punishment through job loss, demotion, denial of employment, denial of educational opportunities, housing restrictions, and refusal to grant travel requests, also prevailed. Another means by which the Husák regime maintained control was to offer considerable consumer gains as a substitute for the loss of personal freedom. Government policies in the first half of the 1970s resulted in high economic growth and large increases in personal consumption. The widespread availability of material goods placated the general populace and promoted overall acceptance of Husák's stringent political controls. During the late 1970s, however, Czechoslovakia's economy began to stagnate, and the regime's ability to appease the population by providing material benefits diminished. Although the Husák regime succeeded in preserving the status quo in Czechoslovakia for nearly two decades, it faced in the 1980s both internal and external pressures to reform.;;;;;;;;;;X

hungary_pan-european_picnic_desc;On 2 May 1989, the first visible cracks in the Iron Curtain appeared when Hungary began dismantling its 240 kilometres (150 mi) long border fence with Austria. The relatively open border with the West allowed hundreds of East Germans on holiday in Hungary to escape to Austria and then travel safely to West Germany. The open border infuriated many Soviet Bloc governments who feared a return to a pre-Berlin Wall day when thousands of East Germans fled daily to West Berlin. Although worried, the Soviet Union took no overt actions against Hungary, taking a hands-off approach. The most famous crossing came on 19 August, when during a ''friendship picnic'' between Austrians and Hungarians over 900 East Germans rushed the border and escaped into Austria. It was organised by the Paneuropean Union and the Hungarian opposition Hungarian Democratic Forum under the protection of Otto von Habsburg and Imre Pozsgay.;;;;;;;;;;X

This increasingly destabilized the GDR and Czechoslovakia over the summer and autumn as thousands of their citizens illegally crossed over to the West through the Hungarian-Austrian border. In September 1989, more than 13,000 East Germans managed to escape to the West through Hungary. The Hungarian government told their furious East German counterparts that international treaties on refugees took precedence over a 1969 agreement between the two countries restricting freedom of movement. Thousands of East Germans also tried to reach the West by staging sit-ins at West German diplomatic facilities in other East European capitals, especially in Prague, Czechoslovakia.

He liked to call this a ''model change'' (i.e. reforms and refinements within the Communist framework), as opposed to a total ''system change'', i.e. the replacement of Communism by a Western-style system. As 1989 wore on, Grósz was increasingly sidelined by the radical reformers within the party, including Németh, Rezso Nyers, Gyula Horn and Imre Pozsgay. He tried to slow down, stop or reverse the radical changes advocated by his adversaries that were aimed at establishing a Western-type political system and market economy in Hungary. He opposed the rehabilitation of the executed Imre Nagy, Prime Minister during the 1956 revolution. Hoping to defuse the campaign to rehabilitate Nagy, Grósz broke the news of the latter's earlier NKVD ties in a speech at the September 1, 1989 meeting of the HSWP Central Committee, but those present decided not to publish the facts. However, his fate was sealed when he agreed to meet with Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu to discuss what to do with a large number of ethnic Hungarians who had fled Romania.

At that point, longtime leader János Kádár had been removed from power for almost a year, and the Communists' Central Committee that month admitted the necessity of a multiparty system. Mass demonstrations on March 15, the National Day, persuaded the regime to begin negotiations with the emergent non-Communist political forces.;;;;;;;;;;X
hungary_round_table_talks_1_desc;An agreement was reached involving six draft laws that covered an overhaul of the Constitution, establishment of a Constitutional Court, the functioning and management of political parties, multiparty elections for National Assembly deputies, the penal code and the law on penal procedures (the last two changes represented an additional separation of the Party from the state apparatus). The electoral system was a compromise: about half of the deputies would be elected proportionally and half by the majoritarian system. A weak presidency was also agreed upon, but no consensus was attained on who should elect the president (parliament or the people) and when this election should occur (before or after parliamentary elections). Initially, the opposition was united in wanting the president elected by parliament after new elections to ensure parliamentary supremacy and minimise the MSzMP's power. Then, faced with Communist concessions, the relatively weak opposition split, as at least three moderate groups (including KNDP and MDF) signed the Round Table agreement and implicitly accepted Pozsgay as president while the radicals (notably Fidesz and the SzDSz) refused to do so. After a burst of negotiations, fully free elections were scheduled for March 1990, in contrast to the semi-free elections held in Poland in June 1989. In the end, the implicit deal on the presidency (the only place where the Communists appeared to have gotten the upper hand) reached in the Round Table Talks was reversed: when the MSzMP dissolved itself in early October and became the MSZP, a majority of members as well as MPs failed to join the new party, and Pozsgay was not elected its leader.;;;;;;;;;;X

In the ensuing power vacuum, the radicals used the very liberal initiative law formulated by the Round Table to successfully campaign for a referendum on four additional issues. The referendum, held on 26 November, asked questions on the dissolution of the party militia, the return of party assets, the elimination of the party from the workplace and whether presidential or parliamentary elections should be held first. They easily obtained the 100,000 signatures needed to place the questions on the ballot. The reform Communists quickly abolished the party militia, promised a full accounting of its assets before the referendum, and removed its cells from the workplace. On the crucial question of the election sequence, the radicals barely satisfied both criteria (55 percent turnout, with 50 percent needed, and 50.07 percent supporting parliamentary elections first).

The student-led hunger strike galvanized support for the demonstrators around the country and the protests spread to 400 cities by mid-May. Ultimately, China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping and other party elders resolved to use force. Party authorities declared martial law on May 20, and mobilized as many as 300,000 troops to Beijing. In the aftermath of the crackdown, the government conducted widespread arrests of protesters and their supporters, cracked down on other protests around China, expelled foreign journalists and strictly controlled coverage of the events in the domestic press. The police and internal security forces were strengthened. Officials deemed sympathetic to the protests were demoted or purged. In Beijing, the military response to the protest by the PRC government left many civilians in charge of clearing the square of the dead and severely injured. The Chinese government condemned the protests as a ''counter-revolutionary riot'', and has prohibited all forms of discussion or remembrance of the events since.

belavezha_accords_1_desc;On 12 December, the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR formally ratified the Belavezha Accords and denounced the 1922 Union Treaty. The Russian deputies were also recalled from the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. The legality of this action was questionable, since Soviet law did not allow a republic to unilaterally recall its deputies. However, no one in Russia raised any objections. No objections came from the Kremlin either, though they would have likely had no effect since what remained of the Soviet government had been rendered impotent long before then. In effect, the largest and most powerful republic had seceded from the Union. Later that day, Gorbachev hinted for the first time that he was considering stepping aside. It was now clear that the momentum toward dissolution could not be stopped.;;;;;;;;;;X

economic_conditions_deteriorate_desc;The Era of Stagnation in the mid-1970s was aggravated by the war in Afghanistan in 1979 and led to a period of economic standstill between 1979 and 1985. Soviet military buildup at the expense of domestic development kept the USSR's GDP at the same level during the first half of the 1980s. The complex demands of the modern economy and inflexible administration overwhelmed and constrained the central planners. By 1982 the stagnation of the Soviet economy was obvious, as evidenced by the fact that the Soviet Union had been importing grain from the U.S. throughout the 1970s, but the system was so firmly entrenched that any real change seemed impossible.  Because of our lethargy to reform the economy, the average annual income stagnated, since needed economic reforms were never fully carried out. Also, the 1986 oil price collapse benefited oil-consuming countries such as the United States, Japan, Europe, and Third World nations, but represented a serious loss in revenue for the Soviet Union and the subsidies given to the satellites states also helped to deepen the crisis. Corruption remains widespread, citizens lack even the most basic goods and the collapse of the economy seems imminent. Most of our aides suggest that we should let go of the arms race and strike a bargain with the USA in exchange for financial aid.;;;;;;;;;;X

war_of_laws;The War of Laws;;;;;;;;;;X
war_of_laws_desc;During the 1980s, legislative gridlock developed between the Soviet government and its union republics. Multiple laws were passed by the republics giving them jurisdiction over their own territory, these were overturned by Moscow as unconstitutional. In response, the republics officially stated that Moscow's rulings were not relevant to the matter over which the original law had been passed. This led to a constant conflict over constitutional wording and whether the republics or Moscow was supreme in the law. The republics began to assert their sovereignty over their regions: first Lithuania, in 1989, followed by the other 14 in 1990. Native languages were readopted instead of Russian, alienating some large cities made up of Russian citizens, which in turn led to the creation of even more individual, smaller republics. These new governments continued the war of laws by rejecting new laws passed by Moscow and creating their own. While sometimes the laws passed by the republics were contradictory, they were largely almost identical to those being passed in Moscow, forming a system of what was termed ''parallel power''.;;;;;;;;;;X

abkhazian_letter_desc;At the end of the 1980s, ethnic tensions grew between the Abkhaz and Georgians over Georgia's moves towards independence.

The dispute turned violent on 16 July 1989 in Sukhumi. Sixteen Georgians are said to have been killed and another 137 injured when they tried to enroll in a Georgian University instead of an Abkhaz one. After several days of violence, Soviet troops restored order in the city and blamed rival nationalist paramilitaries for provoking confrontations. In June 1988, the so-called Abkhaz Letter  was an 87-page document signed by 60 important representatives of the Abkhaz intelligentia. The letter was completed on 17 June 1988 and sent to Gorbachev.

The anti-Soviet movement became more active in the Georgian SSR in 1988. Several strikes and meetings were organized by anti-Soviet political organizations in Tbilisi. The conflict between the Soviet government and Georgian nationalists deepened after the so-called Lykhny Assembly on March 18, 1989, when several thousand Abkhaz demanded secession from Georgia and restoration of the Union republic status of 1921–1931. In response, the anti-Soviet groups organized a series of unsanctioned meetings across the republic, claiming that the Soviet government was using Abkhaz separatism in order to oppose the pro-independence movement. The protests reached their peak on April 4, 1989, when tens of thousands of Georgians gathered before the House of Government on Rustaveli Avenue in Tbilisi. The protesters, led by the Independence Committee organized a peaceful demonstration and hunger strikes, demanding the punishment of Abkhaz secessionists and restoration of Georgian independence. Local Soviet authorities lost control over the situation in the capital and were unable to contain the protests. First Secretary of the Georgian Communist Party Jumber Patiashvili asked USSR leadership to send troops to restore order and impose curfew.;;;;;;;;;;X

Having mostly boycotted the all-Union referendum on continued federation and the negotiations on a new union treaty on 17 March, Georgia became the fourth Soviet republic, after the three Baltic states, to organize the referendum on the issue of independence. The only question of the referendum asked: ''Do you support the restoration of the independence of Georgia in accordance with the Act of Declaration of Independence of Georgia of May 26, 1918?'' The official results showed over 99 percent in favor with a 90.6 percent voter turnout.

georgian_independence_desc;Shevardnadze's appointment as Soviet Foreign Minister in 1985 brought his replacement in Georgia by Jumber Patiashvili, a conservative and generally ineffective Communist who coped poorly with the challenges of perestroika. Towards the end of the late 1980s, increasingly violent clashes occurred between the Communist authorities, the resurgent Georgian nationalist movement and nationalist movements in Georgia's minority-populated regions (notably South Ossetia). On April 9, 1989, Soviet troops were used to break up a peaceful demonstration at the government building in Tbilisi. Twenty Georgians were killed and hundreds wounded and poisoned. The event radicalised Georgian politics, prompting many—even some Georgian communists—to conclude that independence was preferable to continued Soviet rule. On October 28, 1990, democratic parliamentary elections were held, and on November 15 the nation was renamed the ''Republic of Georgia.'' It declared independence on April 9, 1991, under Zviad Gamsakhurdia.;;;;;;;;;;X

Demonstrations started in the morning of December 17, 1986 as an initial number of 200–300 students gathered in front of the Central Committee building on Brezhnev square to protest the decision of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) to replace Kunayev with Kolbin. The number of protesters increased to 1,000–5,000 as students from universities and institutes joined the crowd on Brezhnev square. As a response, the CPK Central Committee ordered troops from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, druzhiniki (volunteers), cadets, policemen, and the KGB to cordon the square and videotape the participants. The situation escalated around 5 pm, as troops were ordered to disperse the protesters. Clashes between the security forces and the demonstrators continued throughout the night in the square and in different parts of Almaty. The second day, protests turned into civil unrest as clashes in the streets, universities, and dormitories between troops, volunteers, militia units, and Kazakh students turned into a wide-scale confrontation. The clashes could only be controlled on the third day. The Almaty events were followed by smaller protests and demonstrations in Shymkent, Pavlodar, Karaganda and Taldykorgan.;;;;;;;;;;X

The region that the earthquake occurred is vulnerable to occasional large and destructive earthquakes and is part of a larger active seismic belt that stretches from the Alps to the Himalayas. Activity in the area is associated with tectonic plate boundary interaction and the source of the event was a slip of a thrust fault just to the north of Spitak. Despite the tensions of the Cold War, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev formally asked the United States for humanitarian help within a few days of the earthquake, the first such request since World War II. One hundred and thirteen countries sent substantial amounts of humanitarian aid to the Soviet Union in the form of rescue equipment, search teams and medical supplies, but private donations and assistance from non-governmental organizations also had a large part of the international effort.

On the next day, one of the biggest companies of the country, Vladimir Lenin Steelworks in Krakow, joined the strike. The workers demanded salary increase, re-employment of Solidarity activists, who had been fired during the martial law, as well as legalization of Solidarity. Meanwhile, a strike broke out in Stalowa Wola Steelworks. Both these actions were suppressed by the Communist security forces (ZOMO), supported by anti-terrorist units. In Stalowa Wola, a demonstration of force, together with threats of use of regular army troops, was sufficient, and the strikers gave up on April 30. In Kraków, however, the workers continued their action, therefore the government decided to use power.

In the second half of August, further mines, most from southern Upper Silesia joined the strikers, and the Interfactory Strike Committee under Krzysztof Zakrzewski was founded in Jastrzebie-Zdroj. Miners from Jastrzebie-Zdroj were supported by a local priest, reverend Bernard Czernecki. On September 2, Lech Walesa appeared in the July Manifesto coalmine, the last place that continued the strike. After his appeal, and a long argument, the miners decided to give up.

According to Alojzy Szablewski, who was leader of plant’s Solidarity, Lech Walesa was called, and during a meeting it was decided the strike would begin on Monday, August 22. On that day, at 7 a.m., some 3000 workers put away their tools. Their only demand was short - legalization of Solidarity. Soon afterwards, other main factories of Gdansk joined the shipyard - Port Polnocny, Stocznia Polnocna, Stocznia Remontowa. Interfactory Strike Committee was founded, led by Jacek Merkel, and workers were supported by a number of personalities, such as Jacek Kuron, Adam Michnik, Lech Kaczynski, and his twin brother Jaroslaw Kaczynski. Unlike in August 1980, the 1988 strike was different, as the government lacked power to force the strikers to give up. Furthermore, Gdansk Lenin Shipyard was visited by a number of guests from abroad, including Boston Mayor Ray Flynn, in whose presence the use of force was not likely. The events in Gdansk were described by Padraic Kenney as truly Orange Alternative strike. Workers of the Gdansk Repair Shipyard mocked secret service and police agents, by making a styrofoam tank with the slogan: Leave your arms at the gate, we want dialogue. The strikes in Gdamsk ended on September 1, and on September 3, both sides signed an agreement, according to which the communists promised not to persecute the strikers.

rev_poland_9_desc;By far the biggest strike of summer 1988 took place in Stalowa Wola Steelworks, in which around 10,000 workers participated, and the plant was surrounded by militarized police units. The Stalowa Wola strike was so significant, that it was dubbed ''the fourth nail in the coffin of Communism''. Since the Steelworks was an arms manufacturer, the factory, which in the 1980s employed around 21,000 people, was under a watchful eye of the security services, and its employees were strictly prohibited from undertaking any kind of oppositional activities. Nevertheless, across the 1980s, it was one of main centers of protests and demonstrations, and in spring of 1988, Stalowa Wola workers started the first strike of that year, which ended after a few days, and which was a prelude of the summer events. On August 22 in the morning, workers of the plant decided to organize a sit-in, with only one demand - legalization of Solidarity. This decision was crucial for further events in Poland, as strikes in Upper Silesia were slowly coming to an end. Led by Wieslaw Wojtas, the strike lasted 11 days. Workers were supported by local priests, and activists of the so-called Supporting Office, who delivered food, medicine, blankets, helped those beaten by government security forces, but also informed Western Europe about situation in Stalowa Wola. Every day, citizens of the town gathered by the Gate 3 to the steelworks, where local parish priest, reverend Edmund Frankowski, celebrated two masses, which were attended by up to 10 000 people. Frankowski actively supported the strikers, in the sermons, he urged the faithful to help the workers. The Stalowa Wola strike ended on September 1, after the personal request of Lech Walesa, who called Wies?aw Wojtas, telling him: ''You are great, but please, end the strike, I am asking you in the name of Solidarity''. Following Walesa's request, 4,000 workers left the factory on September 1, at 7 p.m. Together with around 15,000 inhabitants of the city, they marched to the Church of Mary, Queen of Poland, where they were greeted by reverend Frankowski, who said: ''Illegal priest is welcoming participants of the illegal strike''.;;;;;;;;;;X

rev_poland_10_desc;Following the factory strikes of the early 1980s and the subsequent formation of the (then still underground) Solidarity movement under the leadership of Lech Walesa the political situation in Poland started relaxing somewhat. Despite an attempt by the government to crack down on the anti-Communist sentiments, the movement had gained too much momentum and it became impossible to hold off change anymore. In addition there was fear of a social explosion due to economic malaise and runaway inflation that had depressed Polish living standards and deepened public anger and frustration. By 1988 the authorities began serious talks with the opposition. In September 1988, when a wave of strikes was coming to an end, a secret meeting was held which included amongst others the opposition leader Lech Walesa and Minister of Internal Affairs Czeslaw Kiszczak. They agreed on holding the so-called Round Table talks in the near future to plan out the course of action to be undertaken in the country. The Round Table talks began on February 6, 1989 at 2:23 pm CET . They included the solidarity opposition faction and the coalition government faction. The talks were held in the Council of Ministers Office. The meetings were co-chaired by Lech Walesa and Czeslaw Kiszczak. The Polish Communists, led by General Jaruzelski, hoped to co-opt prominent opposition leaders into the ruling group without making major changes in the political power structure. In reality, the talks radically altered the shape of the Polish government and society.;;;;;;;;;;X

rev_poland_11_desc;An agreement was signed on April 4, 1989. The most important demands, including those reflected in the April Novelization, were: Legalization of independent trade unions, the introduction of the office of President (thereby annulling the power of the Communist party general secretary), who would be elected to a 6-year term and the formation of a Senate. As a result, real political power was vested in a newly created bicameral legislature and in a president who would be the chief executive. Solidarity became a legitimate and legal political party. Free election to 35 percent of the seats in Sejm (parliament) and an entirely free election to the Senate was assured.;;;;;;;;;;X

The Solidarity leaders, however, managed to convince the PZPR's longtime satellite parties, the ZSL and SD (some of whom already owed a debt to Solidarity for endorsing them during the second round) to switch sides, and create a coalition government with Solidarity. PZPR, which had 37.6 percent of the seats, suddenly found itself in minority. Abandoned by Moscow, Kiszczak resigned on August 14. With no choice but to appoint a Solidarity member as prime minister, on August 24 Jaruzelski appointed Solidarity activist, Tadeusz Mazowiecki as head of a Solidarity-led coalition, ushering a brief period described as ''Your president, our prime minister''. The elected parliament would be known as the Contract Sejm, from the ''contract'' between the Solidarity and the communist government which made it possible in the first place.

Around a third of eligible voters did not participate, defying the regime. Only 44 percent of Poland's 26 million eligible voters voted yes to the question on economic reform, and 46 percent voted yes to the second question on ''democratisation'' in Poland. Even though a majority of the votes cast supported the propositions, according to the rules of the referendum the majority of eligible voters had to vote yes in order for the referendum to pass. The resulting failure of the referendum was unprecedented, as it was the first time that Communist authorities in Eastern Europe had lost a vote. The government of Zbigniew Messner lost the referendum - according to independent sources, with the turnout of around 30 percent , but officially, it was announced that 63.8 percent voters participated in it, and so, deputy prime minister Zdzislaw Sadowski decided to go on with the price increase.;;;;;;;;;;X

In response, the Supreme Soviet (parliament) of the Ukrainian SSR in a special Saturday session overwhelmingly approved the Act of Declaration.

estonia_independence_desc;Early in 1991, Soviet leaders opted for the use of force to quash the Baltic bids for independence. Bloody events in Vilnius and Riga led to barricades in the streets of Tallinn as well. The intervention of Russian President Boris Yeltsin helped resolve the crisis. The Baltic question had by this time risen to the level of international politics, a topic in talks among superpowers. A public poll held on 3 March 1991 also helped the cause, forestalling a pan-Soviet referendum on the issue of preservation of the Soviet Union. In the Estonian poll, 77 percent voted for Estonian independence. Moscow continued to wave a treaty of union at the Estonians, hinting at economic sanctions in the case of non-compliance. The impasse was resolved by an attempted coup by Soviet hardliners on 19 August 1991, which failed rapidly. In Estonia, an understanding was reached between the two rival political movements, and in defiance of approaching tanks, the Supreme Council in coordination with the Congress of Estonia adopted a decision on national independence on 20 August 1991.;;;;;;;;;;X

lithuania_independence;The Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania;;;;;;;;;;X
lithuania_independence_desc;As Mikhail Gorbachev attempted to revive economy of the Soviet Union, he introduced glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring). These reforms encouraged changes within the Soviet government and invited the public into discussions. For the activists, it was an opportunity to bring their movements from underground into the public life. On August 23, 1987 (48th anniversary of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact), the Lithuanian Liberty League organized the first public protest rally that did not result in arrests. In mid-1988, a group of 35 intellectuals organized S?judis Reform Movement with the officially stated goal of supporting, discussing, and implementing Gorbachev's reforms. S?judis grew in popularity, attracting large crowds to rallies in Vingis Park and radicalizing its agenda. The movement, afraid of angering Moscow and causing a violent clampdown, continuously pushed further with its demands: from limited discussions on Gorbachev's reforms, to demand of greater say in economic decisions, to political autonomy within the Soviet Union. By the time of the Baltic Way, a human chain spanning over 600 kilometres (370 mi) across the three Baltic states to mark the 50th anniversary of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, full independence was the official goal. The Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania or Act of March 11 was an independence declaration by the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic adopted on March 11, 1990. Signed by all members of the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR, the act emphasized restoration and legal continuity of the interwar-period Lithuania, which was occupied by the USSR and lost independence in June 1940.;;;;;;;;;;X

Economic and energy shortages undermined public faith in the newly restored state. The Soviet Union attempted to suppress the secession by imposing an economic blockade. The inflation rate reached 100 percent and continued to increase rapidly. The fact that Lithuania had proclaimed independence unilaterally also caused discontent among the minorities of Russian and Polish descent, many of whom were supporters of the Moscow-backed branch of the Lithuanian Communist Party and the largely communist-dominated Yedinstvo movement. Tension rose sharply in the early days of 1991. During the five days preceding the events, Russian, Polish, and other workers at Vilnius factories protested the government's consumer goods price hikes and what they saw as ethnic discrimination.;;;;;;;;;;X

Prunskiene flew to countries all over the world, including the United States, to try to gain support for negotiations with Gorbachev about the embargo through such committees as the Helsinki Commission. After nine months in office, on January 8, the conflict between Chairman of the Parliament Vytautas Landsbergis and the more pragmatic Prime Minister Kazimira Prunskiene culminated in her resignation.

The official explanation was that this was needed to ensure constitutional order and the effectiveness of laws of the Lithuanian SSR and the Soviet Union. On January 10, Gorbachev addressed the Supreme Council, demanding restoration of the constitution of the USSR in Lithuania and the revocation of all anti-constitutional laws. He mentioned that military intervention could be possible within days. When Lithuanian officials asked for Moscow's guarantee not to send armed troops, Gorbachev did not reply.;;;;;;;;;;X

Deputy Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union, General Vladislav Achalov, arrived in Lithuania and took control of all military operations. People from all over Lithuania started to encircle the main strategic buildings: the Supreme Council, the Radio and Television Committee, the Vilnius TV Tower and the main telephone exchange. Soviet military units seize the base of the Lithuanian SSR Special Purpose Detachment of Police (OMON) and unsuccessfully try to seize the Police Academy building in Vilnius. A column of Soviet military vehicles is spotted leaving a military base in Vilnius and moving towards the city center. Employees of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Lithuania instruct special worker groups (druzhinas) to be ready ''for special events.'' An unknown group of individuals who claim to be part of the National Salvation Committee, declare at the Supreme Council that it is their duty to take over Lithuania in order to avoid an economic meltdown and a fratricidal war. Another column of military vehicles (including tanks and BMPs) is spotted leaving the military base and heading toward the TV tower.;;;;;;;;;;X
lithuania_independence_6-3_desc;Upon arrival in the vicinity of the TV tower, tanks start to fire blank rounds. This causes many nearby windows to shatter and lifelong hearing loss or deafness in some of the protesters. Tanks and soldiers encircle the TV tower. Soldiers fire live ammunition overhead and into civilian crowds gathered around the building. Tanks drive straight through lines of people. Fourteen people are killed in the attack, most of them shot and two crushed by tanks. One Soviet Alfa unit member (Viktor Shatskikh) is killed by friendly fire. Loudspeakers on several BMPs transmit the voice of Juozas Jermalavicius: ''Brother Lithuanians! The nationalist and separatist government which confronted the people has been overthrown! Go [home] to your parents and children!'' BMPs and tanks surround the Radio and Television Committee building. Soldiers fire live ammunition into the building, over the heads of the civilian crowds. The live television broadcast is terminated. The last pictures transmitted are of a Soviet soldier running toward the camera and switching it off. A small TV studio from Kaunas came on air unexpectedly. A technician of the family program that usually broadcast from Kaunas once a week was on the air, calling for anyone who could help to broadcast to the world in as many different languages as possible about the Soviet army and tanks killing unarmed people in Lithuania. Within an hour, the studio was filled with several university professors broadcasting in several languages. The small studio in Kaunas received a threatening phone call from the Soviet army division of Kaunas (possibly the 7th Guards Airborne Division of the Soviet Airborne Forces). By 4 in the morning this studio received the news that a Swedish news station finally saw the broadcast and would be broadcasting the news to the world. The second phone call from the Soviet army division followed shortly, with a commander stating that ''they would not try to take over the studio so long as no misinformation is given''. This was all broadcast live.;;;;;;;;;;X
lithuania_independence_6-4_desc;Following these two attacks, large crowds (20,000 during the night, more than 50,000 in the morning) of independence supporters gathered around the Supreme Council building.

Following the first news reports from Lithuania, the government of Norway appealed to the United Nations. The government of Poland expressed their solidarity with the people of Lithuania and denounced the actions of the Soviet army. After the events, President Gorbachev said Lithuanian ''workers and intellectuals'' complaining of anti-Soviet broadcasts had tried to talk to the republic's parliament, but were refused and beaten. Then, he said, they asked the military commander in Vilnius to provide protection. Defense Minister Dmitry Yazov, Interior Minister Boris Pugo and Gorbachev all asserted that no one in Moscow gave orders to use force in Vilnius. Yazov said that nationalists were trying to form what he called a bourgeois dictatorship. Pugo said on national television that the demonstrators had opened fire first. During the following day, meetings of support took place in many cities (Kiev, Riga, Tallinn). Although occupation and military raids continued for several months following the attacks, there were no large open military encounters after January 13. Strong Western reaction and the actions of Russian democratic forces put the President and the government of the Soviet Union in an awkward position.;;;;;;;;;;X

latvia_independence_desc;The Declaration ''On the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia'' was adopted on 4 May 1990, by the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR. The Declaration stated that, although Latvia had de facto lost its independence in 1940, when it was annexed by the Soviet Union, the country had de jure remained a sovereign country as the annexation had been unconstitutional and against the will of the people of Latvia. Therefore it resolved that the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940 were illegal, and annulled the declaration on the accession of Latvia to the Soviet Union of 21 July 1940, re-instituted the Constitution of Latvia of 1922, which was thereupon partly suspended, and set a period of transition to de facto independence, which would end upon the first session of Saeima. It also ruled that during the transitional period the Constitution of the Latvian SSR and other laws would remain applicable as long as they did not contradict articles 1, 2, 3 and 6 of the Constitution of Latvia, which were reinforced by the declaration. It was provided that a committee to elaborate a new edition of the Constitution of Latvia should be created. Social, economic, cultural and political rights were granted to citizens and residents of Latvia in accordance with international human rights. The declaration also stated that Latvia would form its relationship with the Soviet Union on the basis of the Latvian–Soviet Peace Treaty of 1920, in which the Soviet Union had recognized the independence of Latvia as inviolable ''for all future time''.;;;;;;;;;;X

latvia_independence_2_desc;On 4 May 1990, after the declaration was adopted, the Communist Party of Latvia resolved that it was unconstitutional, contained notable contradictions and historical inaccuracies, and noted that such issues should be decided by referendum. The Communist Party deemed that the declaration might trigger the President of the Soviet Union to take countermeasures, therefore the party should launch a propaganda campaign against the declaration and ask the President of the Soviet Union to annul the declaration of the Supreme Soviet. On 14 May 1990, the President of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev issued a decree stating that the declaration violated the Constitution of the Soviet Union and the Constitution of the Latvian SSR and thus stood void from the moment of adoption. The Supreme Council answered that the Constitution of the Soviet Union did not grant the president the right to annul acts adopted by Supreme Soviets of Soviet republics. Furthermore the Supreme Council announced that the Supreme Soviet, as the legal successor of the People's Saeima, had the right to annul its decisions which contradicted the Constitution of Latvia which was in force at the time these decisions were made and as the Constitution of the Soviet Union ruled that the Soviet Union was founded upon principles of self-determination and that the call for a referendum on secession from the Soviet Union to take place has neither a legal or a political basis, because Latvia had been annexed by the Soviet Union without holding a referendum, which was required by the Constitution of Latvia and Latvia was not seceding from the Soviet Union, but restoring its independence.;;;;;;;;;;X

Approximately two million people joined their hands to form a human chain spanning over 600 kilometres (370 mi) across the three Baltic states – Estonian SSR, Latvian SSR, and Lithuanian SSR, republics of the Soviet Union. The demonstration originated in ''Black Ribbon Day'' protests held in the western cities in the 1980s. It marked the 50th anniversary of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. The event was organised by Baltic pro-independence movements: Rahvarinne of Estonia, the Tautas fronte of Latvia, and S?judis of Lithuania. The protest was designed to draw global attention by demonstrating a popular desire for independence for each of the entities. It also illustrated solidarity among the three nations. It has been described as an effective publicity campaign, and an emotionally captivating and visually stunning scene. The event presented an opportunity for the Baltic activists to publicise the illegal Soviet occupation and position the question of Baltic independence not as a political matter, but as a moral issue. The Soviet authorities in Moscow responded to the event with intense rhetoric, but failed to take any constructive actions that could bridge the widening gap between the Baltic states and the Soviet Union.;;;;;;;;;;X

The glut began in the early 1980s as a result of slowed economic activity in industrial countries (due to the crises of the 1970s, especially in 1973 and 1979) and the energy conservation spurred by high fuel prices. The inflation adjusted real 2004 dollar value of oil fell from an average of $78.2 in 1981 to an average of $26.8 per barrel in 1986, a 46 percent drop.;;;;;;;;;;X

CHERNENKO_DEATH_DESC;In the spring of 1984, Chernenko was hospitalized for over a month, but kept working by sending the Politburo notes and letters. He awarded Orders to cosmonauts and writers in his office, but was unable to walk through the corridors of his office and was driven in a wheelchair. By the end of 1984, Chernenko could hardly leave the Central Clinical Hospital, a heavily guarded facility in west Moscow, and the Politburo was affixing a facsimile of his signature to all letters, as Chernenko had done with Andropov's when he was dying. On 10 March he fell into a coma and died as a result of heart failure. He became the third Soviet leader to die in less than three years. He was honored with a state funeral and was buried in the Kremlin necropolis – the last person to be interred there. Grigory Romanov was the second youngest member of the Politburo after Gorbachev. In the months preceding the death of Konstantin Chernenko in March 1985, Romanov and Gorbachev were commonly regarded to be chief rivals in the succession struggle for the post of General Secretary. Viktor Grishin was also considered a viable candidate and a possible alternative to Mikhail Gorbachev. In an attempt to stress his closeness to Chernenko, he dragged the terminally ill Soviet leader out to vote in early 1985. This action by Grishin backfired and was almost universally viewed as a cruel act. He then declined to put himself forward as a candidate for succession and instead offered his support, albeit lukewarm, to Gorbachev. who was subsequently unanimously elected as the General Secretary. Now you must choose who will succeed as General Secretary:;;;;;;;;;;X

spain_1_desc;The 1985 El Descanso bombing was a bomb attack against the El Descanso restaurant just outside Madrid, Spain, late on April 12, 1985. The explosion killed 18 Spaniards and injured 82 others, including 11 American servicemen, who were believed to be the target of the attack. American servicemen who worked at nearby Torrejón Air Base frequented the restaurant. Spanish Interior Minister Jose Barrionuevo blamed the Islamic Jihad Organization, which claimed responsibility for the blast, for the bombing. However, the case was closed in 1987 due to a lack of arrests.;;;;;;;;;;X

sov_decision_2_desc;In 1977 Sharansky was arrested on charges of spying for the DIA and treason and sentenced to 13 years of forced labor in Perm 35, a Siberian labor camp (Gulag). Sharansky appeared in a March 1990 edition of National Geographic magazine. The article, ''Last Days of the Gulag'' by Mike Edwards, profiles through photographs and text one of the few remaining Soviet prison labor camps (known as the Gulag). The article featured a photo of Sharansky and his wife Avital in their home in Israel viewing photos of the same Gulag where Sharansky had been imprisoned, but as it appeared in 1990. Sharansky remarked in the article that after viewing images of the prisoner's faces he could discern that the protocol of oppression was still at work. The author also showed Sharansky a photo of the cold isolation cell where Sharansky had himself been confined. Sharansky commented with irony that conditions had improved slightly — the stark cell now featured a thin bench bolted to the middle of the floor. He said that if that bench had existed when he was there he could have utilized it to sleep, albeit uncomfortably. As a result of an international campaign led by his wife, Avital Sharansky (including assistance from East German lawyer Wolfgang Vogel, New York Congressman Benjamin Gilman and Rabbi Ronald Greenwald) Sharansky and three low-level Western spies (Czech citizen Jaroslav Javorský and West German citizens Wolf-Georg Frohn and Dietrich Nistroy) were exchanged for Czech spies Karl Koecher and Hana Koecher held in the USA, Soviet spy Yevgeni Zemlyakov, Polish spy Jerzy Kaczmarek and East German spy Detlef Scharfenorth (the latter three held in West Germany) in 1986 on Glienicke Bridge. Sharansky was released in February 1986. He was the first political prisoner ever released by Mikhail Gorbachev due to intense political pressure from Ronald Reagan.;;;;;;;;;;X

sov_afg_war_end_desc;Informal negotiations for a Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan had been underway since 1982. The first step of the Soviet Union's exit strategy was to transfer the burden of fighting the mujahideen to the Afghan armed forces, with the aim of preparing them to operate without Soviet help. During this phase, the Soviet contingent was restricted to supporting the DRA forces by providing artillery, air support and technical assistance, though some large-scale operations were still carried out by Soviet troops. The decision to engage primarily Afghan forces was taken by the Soviets, but was resented by the PDPA, who viewed the departure of their protectors without enthusiasm.;;;;;;;;;;X

The accords consisted of several instruments: a bilateral agreement between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the Republic of Afghanistan on the principles of mutual relations, in particular on non-interference and non-intervention, a declaration on international guarantees, signed by the USSR and the USA, a bilateral agreement between Pakistan and Afghanistan on the voluntary return of Afghan refugees, and an agreement on the interrelationships for the settlement of the situation relating to Afghanistan, signed by Pakistan and Afghanistan and witnessed by the Soviet Union and the United States. The agreements also contained provisions for the timetable of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.

sov_event_1;Shortage of Consumer Goods;;;;;;;;;;X
sov_event_1_desc;Soviet military buildup at the expense of domestic development kept the USSR's GDP at the same level during the first half of the 1980s. The Soviet planned economy was not structured to respond adequately to the demands of the complex modern economy it had helped to forge. The massive quantities of goods produced often did not meet the needs or tastes of consumers. The volume of decisions facing planners in Moscow became overwhelming. The cumbersome procedures for bureaucratic administration foreclosed the free communication and flexible response required at the enterprise level for dealing with worker alienation, innovation, customers, and suppliers. In the 1980s shortages continued in basic consumer items, even in major population centers. Such goods occasionally were rationed in major cities well into the 1980s. Besides the built-in shortages caused by planning priorities, shoddy production of consumer goods limited actual supply. ;;;;;;;;;;X
sov_event_2;The Chernoyl disaster;;;;;;;;;;X
sov_event_2_desc;The Chernobyl disaster was a catastrophic nuclear accident that occurred on 26 April 1986 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine (then officially the Ukrainian SSR), which was under the direct jurisdiction of the central authorities of the Soviet Union. An explosion and fire released large quantities of radioactive particles into the atmosphere, which spread over much of the western USSR and Europe. A state commission was set up the same day (26 April) and tasked with investigating the accident. It was headed by Valery Legasov, who arrived at Chernobyl in the evening of 26 April. By the time Legasov arrived, two people had already died and 52 were receiving medical attention in hospital. By the night of 26–27 April – more than 24 hours after the explosion – Legasov's committee had ample evidence that extremely high levels of radiation had caused a number of cases of radiation exposure. Based on the evidence at hand, Legasov's committee acknowledged the destruction of the reactor and ordered the evacuation of Pripyat. The battle to contain the contamination and avert a greater catastrophe ultimately involved over 500,000 workers and cost an estimated 18 billion rubles. ;;;;;;;;;;X
sov_event_3;Pripyat evacuated!;;;;;;;;;;X
sov_event_3_desc;The nearby city of Pripyat was not immediately evacuated after the incident. The townspeople went about their usual business, completely oblivious to what had just happened. However, within a few hours of the explosion, dozens of people fell ill. Later, they reported severe headaches and metallic tastes in their mouths, along with uncontrollable fits of coughing and vomiting. The evacuation began at 14:00 on 27 April. A translation of the rest of the audio follows: ''For the attention of the residents of Pripyat! The City Council informs you that due to the accident at Chernobyl Power Station in the city of Pripyat the radioactive conditions in the vicinity are deteriorating. The Communist Party, its officials and the armed forces are taking necessary steps to combat this. Nevertheless, with the view to keep people as safe and healthy as possible, the children being top priority, we need to temporarily evacuate the citizens in the nearest towns of Kiev Oblast. For these reasons, starting from April 27, 1986 2 pm each apartment block will be able to have a bus at its disposal, supervised by the police and the city officials. It is highly advisable to take your documents, some vital personal belongings and a certain amount of food, just in case, with you. The senior executives of public and industrial facilities of the city has decided on the list of employees needed to stay in Pripyat to maintain these facilities in a good working order. All the houses will be guarded by the police during the evacuation period. Comrades, leaving your residences temporarily please make sure you have turned off the lights, electrical equipment and water and shut the windows. Please keep calm and orderly in the process of this short-term evacuation.'';;;;;;;;;;X
sov_event_4;Chernobyl disaster broadcast;;;;;;;;;;X
sov_event_4_desc;The general population of the Soviet Union was first informed of the disaster on 28 April, two days after the explosion, with a 20 second announcement in the TV news program Vremya. At that time ABC released its report about the disaster. During that time, all radio broadcasts run by the state were replaced with classical music, which was a common method of preparing the public for an announcement of a tragedy that had taken place. Scientist teams were armed and placed on alert as instructions were awaited. Only after radiation levels set off alarms at the Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant in Sweden, over one thousand kilometers from the Chernobyl Plant, did the Soviet Union admit that an accident had occurred. Nevertheless, authorities attempted to conceal the scale of the disaster. For example, after evacuating the city of Pripyat, the following warning message was read on the state TV: ''There has been an accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. One of the nuclear reactors was damaged. The effects of the accident are being remedied. Assistance has been provided for any affected people. An investigative commission has been set up.'';;;;;;;;;;X

sov_perestroika_1_desc;Mikhail Gorbachev brought a fresh, more expansive style to the Kremlin. With express support for the economic reorganization initiated by Andropov, he introduced the concept of perestroika in April 1985. He intended it to be a program of moderate and controlled reform that would revitalize the economy, while keeping central planning and the leading role of the Communist party.;;;;;;;;;;X
sov_perestroika_2;The Perestroika Challenge;;;;;;;;;;X
sov_perestroika_2_desc;In the years that followed, serious obstacles to perestroika became apparent. A population that had been tyrannized for decades had little work initiative, nor was it disposed to believe its government's new promises. The huge Soviet bureaucracy was vehemently opposed to giving up its privileged status. The Communist old guard wanted no changes at all that would undermine its hold on status, privilege, and wealth. To undermine this resistance Gorbachev brought forward a new policy, called glasnost, in late 1986.;;;;;;;;;;X
sov_law_joint_ventures;Law on Joint Ventures;;;;;;;;;;X
sov_law_joint_ventures_desc;The most significant of Gorbachev's reforms in the foreign economic sector allowed foreigners to invest in the Soviet Union in the form of joint ventures with Soviet ministries, state enterprises, and cooperatives. The original version of the Soviet Joint Venture Law, which went into effect in June 1987, limited foreign shares of a Soviet venture to 49 percent and required that Soviet citizens occupy the positions of chairman and general manager. After potential Western partners complained, the government revised the regulations to allow majority foreign ownership and control. Under the terms of the Joint Venture Law, the Soviet partner supplied labor, infrastructure, and a potentially large domestic market. The foreign partner supplied capital, technology, entrepreneurial expertise, and, in many cases, products and services of world competitive quality.;;;;;;;;;;X
sov_law_state_enterprise;Law on State Enterprise;;;;;;;;;;X
sov_law_state_enterprise_desc;The law stipulated that state enterprises were free to determine output levels based on demand from consumers and other enterprises. Enterprises had to fulfill state orders, but they could dispose of the remaining output as they saw fit. However, at the same time the state still held control over the means of production for these enterprises, thus limiting their ability to enact full-cost accountability. Enterprises bought input from suppliers at negotiated contract prices. Under the law, enterprises became self-financing, that is, they had to cover expenses (wages, taxes, supplies, and debt service) through revenues. No longer was the government to rescue unprofitable enterprises that could face bankruptcy. Finally, the law shifted control over the enterprise operations from ministries to elected workers' collectives. Gosplan's responsibilities were to supply general guidelines and national investment priorities, not to formulate detailed production plans.;;;;;;;;;;X
sov_law_cooperatives;Law on Cooperatives;;;;;;;;;;X
sov_law_cooperatives_desc;The Law on Cooperatives, enacted in May 1988, was perhaps the most radical of the economic reforms during the early part of the Gorbachev era. For the first time since Vladimir Lenin's New Economic Policy, the law permitted private ownership of businesses in the services, manufacturing, and foreign-trade sectors. The law initially imposed high taxes and employment restrictions, but it later revised these to avoid discouraging private-sector activity. Under this provision, cooperative restaurants, shops, and manufacturers became part of the Soviet scene.;;;;;;;;;;X
sov_glasnost_1;Glasnost;;;;;;;;;;X
sov_glasnost_1_desc;Glasnost was the official Soviet governmental policy of openness and transparency implemented in the mid-1980s. It allowed for honesty in discussing the problems and shortcomings of the country, and for consultation in the governing and leadership of the U.S.S.R. Glasnost, which can mean ''publicity,'' encouraged a dissemination of information and was initiated by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985 as a part of his emerging perestroika policy. It was used by Gorbachev to reduce corruption among the Communist leaders of the Soviet government and to curtail the censorship that was characteristic of Communist rule. This lifted the severe restrictions on information and debate which had been part of Soviet life since the 1920s. Gorbachev hoped that glasnost would expose the errors of previous governments, so the people would support more extensive economic reforms. Media censorship was relaxed, though not completely abolished, literature once banned in the USSR was now permitted.;;;;;;;;;;X
sov_democratisation;Demokratizatsiya;;;;;;;;;;X
sov_democratisation_desc;"Demokratizatsiya (Democratisation) in the Soviet Union was proposed by General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev in January 1987. He was calling for the infusion of 'democratic' elements into the Soviet Union's single-party government. Gorbachev's democratisation meant the introduction of multi-candidate-not multiparty-elections for local Communist Party (CPSU) and Soviets. In this way, he hoped to rejuvenate the party with progressive personnel who would carry out his institutional and policy reforms. The CPSU would retain sole custody of the ballot box. The slogan of democratisation was part of Gorbachev's set of reform programs including glasnost (increasing public discussion of issues and accessibility of information to the public), officially announced in mid-1986, and uskoreniye, a 'speed-up' of economic development, which failed miserably. Perestroika (political and economic restructuring), another slogan that became a full-scale campaign in 1987, embraced them all.
By the time he introduced the slogan of democratisation, Gorbachev had concluded that implementing his reforms outlined at the Twenty-Seventh Party Congress in February 1986 required more than discrediting the ''Old Guard''. He changed his strategy from trying to work through the CPSU as it existed and instead embraced a degree of political liberalisation. In January 1987, he appealed over the heads of the party to the people and called for democratisation.";;;;;;;;;;X
sov_congress;Create The Congress of People's Deputies of The USSR;;;;;;;;;;X
sov_congress_desc;The Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union was created as part of Mikhail Gorbachev's reform agenda, and was enabled by Gorbachev's first constitutional change. On 1 July 1988, the fourth and last day of the bruising 19th Party Conference, Gorbachev won the backing of the tired delegates for his last minute proposal to create a new supreme legislative body called the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union. Frustrated by the old guard's resistance to his attempts to liberalise Gorbachev had changed tack and embarked upon a set of constitutional changes to try and separate party and state, and thereby isolate his conservative opponents. Detailed proposals for the new Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union were published for public consultation on 2 October 1988, and to enable the creation of the new legislature the Supreme Soviet, during its 29 November to 1 December 1988 session, implemented the necessary amendments to the 1977 Soviet Constitution, enacted a law on electoral reform, and set the date of the election for 26 March 1989.;;;;;;;;;;X
sov_elections;Elections for The Congress of People's Deputies!;;;;;;;;;;X
sov_elections_desc;While the majority of CPSU-endorsed candidates were elected (84 percent of the Congress consisted of the CPSU candidates by Gorbachev's estimate) over 300 candidates won out over the endorsed candidates. Among them were Boris Yeltsin, who won over the CPSU-endorsed candidate to represent Moscow's district with 89 percent of the vote. It was Yeltsin's first return to political power after resigning from the Politburo in 1987. On a union republic level Yeltsin was also later elected to the RSFSR's Congress and then, indirectly, to its Supreme Soviet. Anti-corruption prosecutor Telman Gdlyan, trapeze artist Valentin Dikul, ethnographer Galina Starovoytova, lawyer Anatoly Sobchak, physicist Andrei Sakharov, weightlifter Yury Vlasov, and hockey player Anatoli Firsov were among the other non-endorsed candidates who were elected to the CPD. All in all, while the majority of seats were won by endorsed candidates, one Politburo member, five Central Committee members, and thirty five regional CPSU chiefs lost re-election to non-endorsed candidates. Gorbachev hailed the elections as a victory for perestroika and the election was praised in state media such as TASS and Izvestia, despite the strong opposition of hardliners within the Politburo and Central Committee. The first session of the new Congress of People's Deputies opened in late May, 1989. Although hardliners retained control of the chamber, the reformers used the legislature as a platform to debate and criticize the Soviet system, with the state media broadcasting their comments live and uncensored on television. Yeltsin managed to secure a seat on the reconstituted Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and in the summer formed the first opposition, the Inter-Regional Deputies Group, formed of Russian nationalists and liberals.;;;;;;;;;;X
sov_presidency;Establish The Office of President of The USSR;;;;;;;;;;X
sov_presidency_desc;Gorbachev began his political reforms in earnest at the end of 1988 by revamping and empowering the legislative branch of the political system in a set of amendments to the existing constitution. Following these institutional changes, Soviet citizens in March 1989 elected a new representative body, the Congress of People's Deputies, from whose ranks a sitting legislature, the USSR Supreme Soviet, was selected to manage legislative affairs between congress meetings. These legislative bodies in turn began to support Gorbachev's attempts to recast the executive institutions of the Soviet state. In late 1989, members of the new Supreme Soviet drafted the Law on the USSR Council of Ministers. Many of these new Soviet legislators, who were part of the first popularly elected representative institution since revolutionary times, envisioned a Government responsible to the legislative branch. It soon became evident, however, at least to Gorbachev and his circle, that the Government could not be overseen effectively by two large and cumbersome legislative bodies. And political oversight of the administrative machinery was especially important at this time, when the party apparatus was abandoning its traditional role of state overseer. As a means of filling this vacuum of authority and of enhancing his own personal power, Gorbachev decided to create a USSR presidency that could take charge of the unwieldy and often obstructionist Government.;;;;;;;;;;X

He expressed his discontent with both the slow pace of reform in society, the servility shown to the General Secretary, and opposition to him from Ligachev making his position untenable, before requesting to resign from the Politburo, adding that the City Committee would decide whether he should resign from the post of First Secretary of the Moscow Communist Party. This was sensational. Besides the fact that nobody had ever quit the Politburo, no one in the party had ever had the audacity to address a leader of the party in such a manner in front of the Central Committee since Leon Trotsky in the 1920s. In his reply, Gorbachev accused Yeltsin of ''political immaturity'' and ''absolute irresponsibility''. Nobody in the Central Committee backed Yeltsin.;;;;;;;;;;X

sov_sinatra_doctrine;The Sinatra Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
sov_sinatra_doctrine_desc;'Sinatra Doctrine'' was the name that the Soviet government of Mikhail Gorbachev used jokingly to describe its policy of allowing neighboring Warsaw Pact nations to determine their own internal affairs. The name alluded to the Frank Sinatra song ''My Way'' — the Soviet Union was allowing these nations to go their own way. This was a major break with the earlier Brezhnev Doctrine, under which the internal affairs of satellite states were tightly controlled by Moscow. This had been used to justify the invasions of Czechoslovakia in 1968 as well as of the non-Warsaw Pact nation of Afghanistan in 1979. By the late 1980s, structural flaws within the Soviet system, growing economic problems, the rise of anti-communist sentiment and the effects of the Afghan war made it increasingly impractical for the Soviet Union to impose its will on its neighbors. The phrase was coined on 25 October 1989 by Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennadi Gerasimov. He appeared on the popular U.S. television program Good Morning America to discuss a speech made two days earlier by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. The latter had said that the Soviets recognized the freedom of choice of all countries, specifically including the other Warsaw Pact states. Gerasimov told the interviewer that, ''We now have the Frank Sinatra doctrine. He has a song, I Did It My Way. So every country decides on its own which road to take.'' When asked whether this would include Moscow accepting the rejection of communist parties in the Soviet bloc. He replied: ''That's for sure… political structures must be decided by the people who live there.'';;;;;;;;;;X

new_union_treaty_4_desc;A referendum on the future of the Soviet Union was held on 17 March 1991. The question put to voters was: ''Do you consider necessary the preservation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as a renewed federation of equal sovereign republics in which the rights and freedom of an individual of any nationality will be fully guaranteed?''. Although the vote was boycotted by the authorities in Armenia, Estonia, Georgia (though not the breakaway province of Abkhazia, where the result was over 98 percent in favour, and in South Ossetia), Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova (though not Transnistria or Gagauzia), turnout was 80 percent across the USSR. The referendum's question was approved by nearly 70 percent of voters in all nine other republics that took part.;;;;;;;;;;X

By August, eight of the nine republics, except Ukraine, approved the draft of the new Treaty with some conditions. Ukraine did not agree on the terms of the Treaty.

The proposal was never implemented in the wake of the August Coup and the eventual dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The overall proposal was resurrected as the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Alas, you have managed to save the country from ruin, the great Soviet Union is in the past but the new Sovereign Union under your leadership will secure it's place in the future.

word_to_the_people_desc;A Word to the People was an open letter signed by a number of Soviet politicians, literati and other figures. The declaration was published in 'Sovetskaya Rossiya' (a newspaper that expressed anti-perestroika views) on 23 July 1991. The authors of the writing appealed to the citizens of the country, severely criticizing the policies of Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin, and they pleaded to avoid the collapse of the Soviet Union, suggesting the formation of new opposition movements. ''§YAn enormous, unforeseen calamity has taken place. Motherland, our land, a great power, given to us to ward with the nature, glorious ancestors, it is perishing, breaking apart, falling into darkness and nonbeing. And this collapse takes place at our silence, toleration and accord.<...> Brethren, too late are we waking up, are observing the misery when our home is already burning in four corners, when extinguishing this has to be done not by water, but by our own tears and blood. <...> Let us unite, so as to stop the chain reaction of the disastrous collapse of the state, economy, human personality, in order to contribute to the strengthening of the Soviet power, to the transformation of it into a genuinely people's power, and not some manger for the hungry nouveaux riches, who are ready to sell off everything for the sake of their insatiable appetite.<...> Soviet Union, this is our home and stronghold, built with enormous efforts of all the peoples and nations, that has saved us from disgrace and slavery at the times of hideous invasions! Russia - unique, beloved! - she is crying for help.§§'' Six days later, Gorbachev, Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev discussed the possibility of replacing such hardliners as Pavlov, Yazov, Kryuchkov and Pugo with more liberal figures. Kryuchkov, who had placed Gorbachev under close surveillance as Subject 110 several months earlier, eventually got wind of the conversation.;;;;;;;;;;X

The next day, Baklanov, Boldin, Shenin, and USSR Deputy Defense Minister General Valentin Varennikov flew to the Crimea for a meeting with Gorbachev. They demanded that Gorbachev either declare a state of emergency or resign and name Yanayev as acting president to allow the members of the GKChP ''to restore order'' in the country.;;;;;;;;;;X

august_coup_2_desc;The 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt, also known as the August Putsch or August Coup, was a coup d'état attempt by a group of members of the Soviet Union's government to take control of the country from Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev. The coup leaders were hard-line members of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) who were opposed to Gorbachev's reform program and the new union treaty that he had negotiated which decentralised much of the central government's power to the republics. The members of the GKChP met in the Kremlin after Baklanov, Boldin, Shenin and Varennikov returned from the Crimea. Yanayev, Pavlov and Baklanov signed the so-called ''Declaration of the Soviet Leadership'' in which they declared the state of emergency in all of the USSR and announced that the State Committee of the State of Emergency had been created ''to manage the country and to effectively maintain the regime of the state of emergency''. Yanayev signed the decree naming himself as acting USSR president on the pretext of Gorbachev's inability to perform presidential duties due to ''illness''. The GKChP banned all newspapers in Moscow, except for nine Party-controlled newspapers. The GKChP also issued a populist declaration which stated that ''the honour and dignity of a Soviet man must be restored.'';;;;;;;;;;X

Armor units of the Tamanskaya Division and the Kantemirovskaya tank division rolled into Moscow along with paratroops. Four Russian SFSR people's deputies (who were considered the most ''dangerous'') were detained by the KGB at an army base near Moscow. The conspirators considered detaining Russian SFSR President Boris Yeltsin upon his arrival from a visit to Kazakhstan on 17 August, or after that when he was on his dacha near Moscow, but for some reason they did not do so.;;;;;;;;;;X
august_coup_3-1_desc;Yeltsin arrived at the White House, Russia's parliament building, at 9am on 19 August. Together with Russian SFSR Prime Minister Ivan Silayev and Supreme Soviet Chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov, Yeltsin issued a declaration in which it was stated that a reactionary anti-constitutional coup had taken place. The military was urged not to take part in the coup. The declaration called for a general strike with the demand to let Mikhail Gorbachev address the people. This declaration was distributed around Moscow in the form of flyers. In the afternoon the citizens of Moscow began to gather around the White House and to erect barricades around it. In response Gennady Yanayev declared the state of emergency in Moscow at 16:00. Yanayev declared at the press conference at 17:00 that Gorbachev was ''resting''. He said: ''Over these years he has got very tired and needs some time to get his health back.'' Meanwhile, Major Evdokimov, chief of staff of a Tamanskaya tank battalion guarding the White House, declared his loyalty to the leadership of the Russian SFSR. Yeltsin climbed one of the tanks and addressed the crowd. Unexpectedly, this episode was included in the state media's evening news.;;;;;;;;;;X

august_coup_4_desc;At noon, Moscow military district commander General Kalinin, whom Yanayev appointed as military commandant of Moscow, declared a curfew in Moscow from 23:00 to 5:00, effective from 20 August. This was understood as the sign that the attack on the White House was imminent. The defenders of the White House prepared themselves, most of them being unarmed. Evdokimov's tanks were moved from the White House in the evening. The makeshift White House defense headquarters was headed by General Konstantin Kobets, a Russian SFSR people's deputy. In the afternoon of 20 August, Kryuchkov, Yazov and Pugo finally decided to attack the White House. This decision was supported by other GKChP members. Kryuchkov and Yazov's deputies, KGB general Ageyev and Army general Achalov, respectively, planned the assault, codenamed ''Operation Grom'' (Thunder), which would gather elements of the Alpha Group and Vympel Groups, with the support of the paratroopers, Moscow OMON, the Internal Troops of the Dzerzhinsky division, three tank companies and a helicopter squadron. Alpha Group commander General Viktor Karpukhin and other senior officers of the unit together with Airborne Troops deputy commander Gen Alexander Lebed mingled with the crowds near the White House and assessed the possibility of such an operation. After that, Karpukhin and Vympel commander Colonel Beskov tried to convince Ageyev that the operation would result in bloodshed and should be canceled. Lebed, with the consent of his immediate superior, Pavel Grachev, returned to the White House and secretly informed the defense headquarters that the attack would begin at 2:00.;;;;;;;;;;X

The crowd later burned the IFV, but no soldiers were killed.;;;;;;;;;;X
august_coup_5-1_desc;The Alpha Group and Vympel did not move to the White House as had been planned and Yazov ordered the troops to pull out from Moscow. The troops began to move from Moscow at 8:00. The GKChP members met in the Defence Ministry and, not knowing what to do, decided to send Kryuchkov, Yazov, Baklanov, Tizyakov, Anatoly Lukyanov, and Deputy CPSU General Secretary Vladimir Ivashko to the Crimea to meet Gorbachev, who refused to meet them when they arrived. With the dacha's communications to Moscow restored, Gorbachev declared all the GKChP's decisions void and dismissed its members from their state offices.

Pugo committed suicide along with his wife the next day. Pavlov, Vasily Starodubtsev, Baklanov, Boldin, and Shenin would be in custody within the next 48 hours. Since several heads of the regional executive committees supported the GKChP, on 21 August the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR adopted Decision No. 1626-1, which authorized Russian President Boris Yeltsin to appoint heads of regional administrations, although the Russian constitution did not empower the president with such authority. It passed another decision the next day which declared the old imperial colors as Russia's national flag. It eventually replaced the Russian SFSR flag two months later.;;;;;;;;;;X

yellow_revolution_1_desc;On August 21, 1983, after a three-year exile in the United States, Ninoy Aquino was assassinated as he was disembarking from a Taiwanese commercial flight at the Manila International Airport. His assassination shocked and outraged many Filipinos, most of whom had lost confidence in the Marcos administration. The event led to more suspicions about the government, triggering non-cooperation among Filipinos that eventually led to outright civil disobedience. It also shook the Marcos government, which was by then deteriorating due, in part, to Marcos’ worsening health. Thus, on November 3, 1985, after pressures from Washington, Marcos suddenly announced that a presidential snap election would take place the following year, one year ahead of the regular presidential election schedule, to legitimize his control over the country. The snap election was legalized with the passage of Batas Pambansa Blg. 883 (National Law No. 883) by the Marcos-controlled unicameral congress called the Regular Batasang Pambansa. The growing opposition movement encouraged Ninoy Aquino's widow, Corazon Aquino, to run for the presidency with Salvador Laurel as running mate for vice-president. Marcos ran for re-election, with Arturo Tolentino as his running mate. The Aquino-Laurel tandem ran under the United Opposition (UNIDO) party, while the Marcos-Tolentino ticket ran under the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (KBL) party.;;;;;;;;;;X
yellow_revolution_2;Snap Election;;;;;;;;;;X
yellow_revolution_2_desc;The elections were held on February 7, 1986. The official election canvasser, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), declared Marcos the winner. The final tally of the COMELEC had Marcos winning with 10,807,197 votes against Aquino's 9,291,761 votes. On the other hand, the final tally of the National Movement for Free Elections (NAMFREL), an accredited poll watcher, had Aquino winning with 7,835,070 votes against Marcos' 7,053,068 points. This electoral exercise was marred by widespread reports of violence and tampering of election results. Because of reports of alleged fraud, the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) issued a statement condemning the elections. The United States Senate also passed a resolution stating the same condemnation. US president Ronald Reagan issued a statement calling the fraud reports as 'disturbing'. In response to the protests, COMELEC claimed that Marcos with 53 percent won over Aquino. However, NAMFREL countered that the latter won over Marcos with 52 percent of votes. On February 15, Marcos was proclaimed by COMELEC and Batasang Pambansa as the winner amidst the controversy. All 50 opposition members of the Parliament walked out in protest. The Filipino people refused to accept the results, however, asserting that Aquino was the real victor. Both 'winners' took their oath of office in two different places, with Aquino gaining greater mass support. Aquino also called for coordinated strikes and mass boycott of the media and businesses owned by Marcos's cronies. As a result, the crony banks, corporations, and media were hit hard, and their shares in the stock market plummeted to record levels.;;;;;;;;;;X
yellow_revolution_3;The People Power Revolution;;;;;;;;;;X
yellow_revolution_3_desc;The People Power Revolution was a series of popular demonstrations in the Philippines that began in 1983 and culminated in 1986. The methods used amounted to a sustained campaign of civil resistance against regime violence and electoral fraud. This case of nonviolent revolution led to the departure of President Ferdinand Marcos and the restoration of the country's democracy. It is also referred to as the Yellow Revolution due to the presence of yellow ribbons during the demonstrations following the assassination of Benigno Aquino, Jr.. It was widely seen as a victory of the people against the 20-year running authoritarian, repressive regime of then president Ferdinand Marcos and made news headlines as 'the revolution that surprised the world'. The majority of the demonstrations took place on a long stretch of Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, more commonly known by its acronym EDSA, in Metropolitan Manila from February 22–25, 1986 and involved over two million Filipino civilians as well as several political, military, and including religious groups led by Cardinal Jaime Sin, the Archbishop of Manila. The protests, fueled by the resistance and opposition from years of corrupt governance by Marcos, culminated with the departure of the dictator from Malacañan Palace to the United States state of Hawaii. Corazon Aquino was proclaimed as the legitimate President of the Philippines after the revolution.;;;;;;;;;;X
fyp_decision;Five-Year Plan;;;;;;;;;;X
fyp_decision_desc;The Five-Year Plans were a series of nation-wide centralized economic plans. The plans were developed by a state planning committee based on the Theory of Productive Forces that was part of the general guidelines of the Communist Party for economic development. The same method of planning was also adopted by most other communist states, including the People's Republic of China. Fulfilling the plan became the watchword of Soviet bureaucracy. Several five-year plans did not take up the full period of time assigned to them: some were successfully completed earlier than expected, while others failed and were abandoned. Altogether, there were thirteen five-year plans. The initial five-year plans were created to serve in the rapid industrialization of the Soviet Union, and thus placed a major focus on heavy industry. The first one was accepted in 1928, for the period from 1929 to 1933, and completed one year early. The last Five-Year Plan was for the period from 1991 to 1995 and was not completed, as the Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991. In game terms, this means that the result of the five-year plan is random, it can either be good or bad. It's a long term bet.;;;;;;;;;;X

cg_shortage_desc;Military buildup at the expense of domestic development kept our economy in stagnation. The planned economy was not structured to respond adequately to the demands of the complex modern economy it had helped to forge. The massive quantities of goods produced often did not meet the needs or tastes of consumers. The volume of decisions facing planners in our capital became overwhelming. The cumbersome procedures for bureaucratic administration foreclosed the free communication and flexible response required at the enterprise level for dealing with worker alienation, innovation, customers, and suppliers. In the 1980s shortages continued in basic consumer items, even in major population centers. Such goods occasionally were rationed in major cities well into the 1980s. Besides the built-in shortages caused by planning priorities, shoddy production of consumer goods limited actual supply. ;;;;;;;;;;X

SPY_1_DESC;John Anthony Walker, Jr. (born 28 July 1937, Washington D.C.)[1] is a former United States Navy Chief Warrant Officer and communications specialist convicted of spying for the Soviet Union from 1968 to 1985. During his time as a Soviet spy, Walker helped the Soviets decipher more than one million encrypted naval messages, organizing a spy operation that The New York Times reported in 1987 ''is sometimes described as the most damaging Soviet spy ring in history. After Walker's arrest, President Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Defense, Caspar Weinberger, concluded that the Soviet Union made significant gains in naval warfare attributable to Walker's spying. Weinberger stated that the information Walker gave Moscow allowed the Soviets ''access to weapons and sensor data and naval tactics, terrorist threats, and surface, submarine, and airborne training, readiness and tactics.'' John Lehman, Secretary of the Navy during the Reagan administration, stated in an interview that Walker's activities enabled the Soviets to know where U.S. submarines were at all times.

Power companies stop operating, the police stop working, gas stations close, grocery stores run out of food, postal workers stop delivering mail, retirement checks stop coming, and banks close their doors with bankers fleeing the country, taking people’s life savings with them.;;;;;;;;;;X

INFLATION_RATE;Our Inflation Rate;;;;;;;;;;X
INFLATION_RATE_DESC;In economics, inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. When the price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services. Consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power per unit of money – a loss of real value in the medium of exchange and unit of account within the economy. Inflation affects an economy in various positive and negative ways. Negative effects of inflation include an increase in the opportunity cost of holding money, uncertainty over future inflation which may discourage investment and savings, and if inflation were rapid enough, shortages of goods as consumers begin hoarding out of concern that prices will increase in the future. Positive effects include reducing the real burden of public and private debt, keeping nominal interest rates above zero so that central banks can adjust interest rates to stabilize the economy, and reducing unemployment due to nominal wage rigidity. Economists generally believe that high rates of inflation and hyperinflation are caused by an excessive growth of the money supply. However, money supply growth does not necessarily cause inflation. Some economists maintain that under the conditions of a liquidity trap, large monetary injections are like ''pushing on a string''. Views on which factors determine low to moderate rates of inflation are more varied. Low or moderate inflation may be attributed to fluctuations in real demand for goods and services, or changes in available supplies such as during scarcities. However, the consensus view is that a long sustained period of inflation is caused by money supply growing faster than the rate of economic growth.;;;;;;;;;;X

In game terms, bonds are an easy way to collect a substantial amount of money and paying off after a long period at low interest rates, ideal for making investments.

9000021desc;Creating public works for the unemployed is an expensive program that aims at creating useful job for unskilled men. It's the provision of employment by the creation of predominantly public goods at a prescribed wage for those unable to find alternative employment. While it is argued that capital investment in public works can be used to reduce unemployment, opponents of internal improvement programs argue that such projects should be undertaken by the private sector, and not the public sector, because public works projects are characteristic of socialism. However, in the private sector, entrepreneurs bear their own losses and so private sector firms are generally unwilling to undertake projects that could result in losses or would not develop a revenue stream. Governments will invest in public works because of the overall benefit to society when there is a lack of private sector benefit (a project that will not generate revenue) or the risk is too great for a private company to accept on its own. Investing in public works projects in order to stimulate the general economy has been a popular policy measure since the economic crisis of the 1930s. This program if succesful, even if expensive, would result in reducing the unemployment and therefore pleasing the population.;;;;;;;;;;X

9000040desc;Public works are a broad category of infrastructure projects, financed and constructed by the government, for recreational, employment, and health and safety uses in the greater community. They include public buildings (municipal buildings, schools, hospitals), transport infrastructure (roads, railroads, bridges, pipelines, canals, ports, airports), public spaces (public squares, parks, beaches), public services (water supply, sewage, electrical grid, dams), and other, usually long-term, physical assets and facilities.;;;;;;;;;;X

9000041name;Bank Bankruptcy;;;;;;;;;;X
9000041desc;The main cause of bank bankruptcy is the bank taking too many risks. Bank crisis have existed all over the world, both in low developed countries and states with powerful economy. Other important potential factors that can generate problems within bank systems are the contagion effect (which can appear in the situation when the problems banks confront with, get to affect solid banks also, like supporting deponents' tendency to withdraw deposits from banks) and, the moral hazard (which can be created when there are expectations for the bank risks to be taken over or absorbed by a third-party, like governments through public debt).;;;;;;;;;;X
9000042name;Bank Run;;;;;;;;;;X
9000042desc;A bank run occurs when a large number of bank customers withdraw their deposits because they believe the bank is, or might become, insolvent. As a bank run progresses, it generates its own momentum, in a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy (or positive feedback): as more people withdraw their deposits, the likelihood of default increases, and this encourages further withdrawals. This can destabilize the economy to the point where it faces financial meltdown. In order to prevent it, the monetary authorities need to implement unconventional policy.;;;;;;;;;;X
9000042text;This is worrying;;;;;;;;;;X
9000043name;Unconventional Monetary Policy;;;;;;;;;;X
9000043desc;Unconventional forms of monetary policy are particularly used when interest rates are at or near 0 percent and there are concerns about deflation or deflation is occurring. These include credit easing, quantitative easing, and signaling. In credit easing, a central bank purchases private sector assets, in order to improve liquidity and improve access to credit. Signaling can be used to lower market expectations for future interest rates;;;;;;;;;;X

9000044name;Financial Meltdown;;;;;;;;;;X
9000044desc;A financial meltdown results in the collapse of large financial institutions, the bailout of banks by national governments and downturns in stock markets around the world. In many areas, the housing market also suffers, resulting in numerous evictions, foreclosures and prolonged unemployment. It contributes to the failure of key businesses, declines in consumer wealth, and a significant decline in economic activity, leading to a severe global economic recession.;;;;;;;;;;X

9000050name;Women Work;;;;;;;;;;X
9000050desc;Prior to the First World War women's role in society in western countries was generally confined to the domestic sphere and to certain types of jobs. In Great Britain for example, just before World War I, out of an adult population of about 24 million women, around 1.7 million worked in domestic service, 800,000 worked in the textile manufacturing industry, 600,000 worked in the clothing trades, 500,000 worked in commerce and 260,000 in local and national government, including teaching. The British textile and clothing trades, in particular, employed far more women than men and could be regarded as 'women's work'. While some women managed to raditional career paths, for the most part women were expected to be primarily involved in 'duties at home' and 'women's work'. Before 1914, only a few countries (New Zealand, Australia, and several Scandinavian nations) had given the right to vote to women, and apart from these countries women were little involved in the political process. With millions of men away fighting and with the inevitable horrendous casualties, there was a severe shortage of labour in a range of industries, from rural and farm work to city office jobs. During both World Wars, women were called on, by necessity, to do work and to take on roles that were outside their traditional gender expectations. In Great Britain this was known as a process of 'Dilution' and was strongly contested by the trade unions, particularly in the engineering and ship building industries.;;;;;;;;;;X

8300102desc;Our country has now a professional military force of volunteers. \n Of 1 million citizens, approximately 2.000 serve in your armed forces any time. \n Your forces recieve an excellent training, only the best candidates are excepted and they are on average more experienced.;;;;;;;;;;X
8300103desc;Our country has enacted a light form of conscription. \n Either a selective conscription or part-time military service, which means only a part of a class of age is incorporated for military service (i.e. USA after the Selective Service Act), or the whole class but for short instruction periods (i.e. Switzerland). \n Of 1 million citizens, approximately 4.500 serve in your armed forces at any time. \n Your forces recieve a good training, only the best candidates are excepted.;;;;;;;;;;X
8300104desc;Our country has enacted a normal conscription. \n A whole class is incorporated in your military for, generally, 1 year. \n Of 1 million citizens, approximately 8.500 serve in your armed forces at any time. \n Your forces recieve an average training.;;;;;;;;;;X
8300105desc;Our country has enacted a extended term conscription. \n By raising the military service term to 2 years, you have two classes of age at your disposal. \n Furthermore, the conscription process is more strict, and less men are postponed or upheld. \n Of 1 million citizens, approximately 13.000 serve in your armed forces at any time. \n Your forces receive an average training.;;;;;;;;;;X
8300106desc;Our country has enacted a long term conscription. \n The conscription of a whole class for at least 3 years. Sometimes it was even longer, and coupled to a selective conscription. \n Of 1 million citizens, approximately 18.000 serve in your armed forces at any time. \n Your forces receive an average training. The long service time is more expensive, but provides you with well experienced reserves in the manpower pool.;;;;;;;;;;X
8300107desc;Our country has enacted a partial mobilization. \n This is often an immediate pre-war measure. Classes that had just accomplished their military service term are recalled under the flag. \n Some reserve units are activated, and reservists are sometimes called back as well. \n Of 1 million citizens, approximately 33.000 serve in your armed forces at any time. \n Your forces receive an average training. \n Newly trained Units no longer benefit from peacetime quality training, and your economy starts to feel initial effects.;;;;;;;;;;X
8300108desc;Our country has enacted a general mobilization. \n This is the standard wartime measure. \n All men between 20 and 45-50 are mobilized, unless necessary for the war in civilian life, all reserve units are activated. \n Of 1 million citizens, approximately 113.000 serve in your armed forces at any time. \n Your forces receive a shortened training, and your economy is running less efficient.;;;;;;;;;;X
8300109desc;Our country has enacted an extended mobilization. \n This is a further effort to face the bloody needs of war. Men previously left back in their factories are transferred to the front, age limits for military service is often pushed to 18-55 years old. \n Of 1 million citizens, approximately 138.000 serve in your armed forces at any time. \n Your forces receive a rushed training, and your economy is struggling to maintain it's pace. \n The unrest in your population becomes harder to control as well.;;;;;;;;;;X
8300110desc;Our country has enacted a total  mobilization. \n This is the supreme sacrifice, the last effort to put men on the battlefield. \n Every man fit for military service is mustered in, with teenagers of 15 and old men up to 65 also incorporated - often as a militia. \n Of 1 million citizens, approximately 153.000 serve in your armed forces at any time. \n Your forces receive barely any training, and your economy is in shambles. \n The unrest in your population is almost impossible to control for a prolonged period.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_1030R_DESC;Near midnight during the changing of the guard, an intense explosion could be heard from near the base of the rear of the Fortification. After a quick inspection, the guards found that someone had detonated an explosive charge under the weakest part of a damaged foundation wall. Search parties were sent out but they failed to find the saboteurs. It is estimated that it will take some time before the fortification is back to full operational strength again.;Peu après minuit, au moment de la relève des factionnaires, une importante explosion a retenti et semblait provenir des fondations à l'arrière de la Fortification. D'après leurs premières constatations, les gardes pensent que quelqu'un a utilisé une charge explosive contre la partie portante d'un mur de soutènement déjà endommagé. Des patrouilles ont aussitôt été envoyées dans toutes les directions mais aucune n'a retrouvé la trace des saboteurs. La fortification ne retrouvera sa pleine capacité opérationnelle qu'à l'issue de réparations qui dureront un temps encore indéterminé.;Vicino la mezzanotte, durante il cambio della guardia, si è sentita una forte esplosione vicino la base della parte posteriore della fortificazione.

Sul posto, sono state inviate delle squadre di ricerca, ma dei sabotatori non c'era traccia. È stato calcolato che ci vorrà del tempo prima che la fortificazione torni nuovamente alla piena attività operativa.;Cerca de la medianoche, durante el cambio de guardia, se oyó una explosión cerca de la base de la fortificación, en la parte de atrás. Tras una rápida inspección, los guardias comprobaron que alguien había detonado una carga explosiva bajo la parte más débil de un muro de carga dañado. Se procedió al envío de grupos de búsqueda, pero no consiguieron encontrar a los saboteadores. Se cree que se tardará un tiempo en volver a poner en funcionamiento la fortificación.;Es war fast Mitternacht als während dem Wachenwechsel eine intensive Explosion aus der nahegelegenen Base auf der Rückseite der Befestigung gehört wurden konnte. Nach einer schnellen Inspektion fanden die Wachen heraus, dass eine Sprengladung unter der schwächsten Stelle einer beschädigten Mauer des Fundaments detoniert war. Suchtrupps wurden entsandt, die aber die Saboteure nicht finden konnten.
