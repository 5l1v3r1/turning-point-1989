DDR_DESC;After causing and losing yet another World War, Germany was divided into two seperate states : The pro-western Federal Republic Germany (FRG) and the communist German Democratic Republic (GDR). While West-Germans soon began to live quite prosperously in their newly established democracy, many East-Germans decided to flee their country to seek fortune in the West, causing the West-German enclave of West-Berlin to be enclosed by the Berlin wall in 1961. After that, the GDR was a strict communist dictatorship, heavily influenced by the Soviet Union. In 1971 Walter Ulbricht was replaced by Erich Honecker. Over time the GDR was governed by old men who got their convictions in the fighting years of the 1930s, 40s and 50s. Will those old men go with the new leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, or will the stick their old socialist views? ;;;;;;;;;;X
DFR_DESC;After causing and losing yet another World War, Germany was divided into two seperate states : The pro-western Federal Republic Germany (FRG) and the communist German Democratic Republic (GDR). While West-Germans soon began to live quite prosperously in their newly established democracy, many East-Germans decided to flee their country to seek fortune in the West, causing the West-German enclave of West-Berlin to be enclosed by the Berlin wall in 1961. After the student movement of 68, the nation gradually began to change from the very conservative Adenauer-era to more liberal politics, culminating in two social-democrats (Brandt & Schmidt) becoming chancellors. In the 70s, a period of terror began: Not only started the communist urban-guerilla campaign by the Red Army Faction (RAF), there were also attacks by palestinians on the Munich olympics and the Landshut plane hijacking. Despite being quite popular, Schmidt was ousted in 1982 by a vote of no confidence, which led to the conservative, christian-democrat Helmut Kohl becoming chancellor, winning a resounding victory in the 83 election. Many hope that he will stop the stagnation of the economy, keep the Soviets out of Germany, and maybe someday even reunite the country.;;;;;;;;;;X
CHC_DESC;After the long civil war with the nationalist forces of Chiang Kai-Shek, The Communist party of China declared victory on October 1st 1949, which is celebrated as the national day. First a close ally to the USSR, the relations between the countries worsened, culminating in bordre clashes and the Sino-Soviet split. The USA began a diplomatic approach to gain an allly in Asia, but there is still the Taiwan question. After pushing the country to the modern era with brutal industrialisation and many famines, including the devastating ''Great Leap Forward'', Mao's death and the rise of Deng Xioping led to open-market reforms which have left China with huge growth rates. But this economical change has been met with demands for political change, and especially the young reject the regime of the Party. Many wonder if political reforms are feasible, or if the Party will continue its harsh rule, maybe even regaining Taiwan.;;;;;;;;;;X
HUN_DESC;After a brief period of Soviet military occupation, János Kádár, Nagy's former Minister of State, was chosen by the Soviet leadership to act as the head of the new government. Kádár quickly normalized the situation. In 1963, the government granted a general amnesty and released the majority of those imprisoned for their active participation in the uprising. Kádár proclaimed a new policy line, according to which the people were no longer compelled to profess loyalty to the party if they tacitly accepted the Socialist regime as a fact of life. In many speeches, he described this as, ''Those who are not against us are with us.'' Kádár introduced new planning priorities in the economy, such as allowing farmers significant plots of private land within the collective farm system. The living standard rose as consumer good and food production took precedence over military production, which was reduced to one-tenth of the pre-revolutionary level. This was followed in 1968 by the New Economic Mechanism (NEM), which introduced free-market elements into Socialist command economy. From the 1960s through the late 1980s, Hungary was often referred to as ''the happiest barrack'' within the Eastern bloc. During the latter part of the Cold War Hungary's GDP per capita was fourth only to East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union itself. As a result of this relatively high standard of living, a more liberalised economy, a less censored press, and less restricted travel rights, Hungary was generally considered one of the more liberal countries in which to live in Eastern Europe during communism. In the 1980s, however, living standards steeply declined yet again due to a worldwide recession to which communism was unable to respond. Politically, the 1980s brought a wave of discontent and demands for reform.;;;;;;;;;;X

CZE_DESC;When Gustáv Husák became the leader of the KSC instead of Alexander Dubcek in April 1969 after the military intervention of Warsaw Pact armies, his regime acted quickly to ''normalize'' the country's political situation. The chief objectives of Husák's normalization were the restoration of firm party rule and the reestablishment of Czechoslovakia's status as a committed member of the socialist bloc. Government policies in the first half of the 1970s resulted in high economic growth and large increases in personal consumption. The widespread availability of material goods placated the general populace and promoted overall acceptance of Husák's stringent political controls. During the late 1970s, however, Czechoslovakia's economy began to stagnate, and the regime's ability to appease the population by providing material benefits diminished. Although the Husák regime succeeded in preserving the status quo in Czechoslovakia for nearly two decades, it faced in the 1980s both internal and external pressures to reform. Domestically, poor economic performance hindered the government's ability to produce the goods needed to satisfy consumer demands.;;;;;;;;;;X
ROM_DESC;In 1965, Nicolae Ceausescu came to power and started to conduct the foreign policy more independently from the Soviet Union. Thus, communist Romania was the only Warsaw Pact country who refused to participate at the Soviet-led 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, it also maintained diplomatic relations with Israel after the 1967 Six-Day War, and established diplomatic relations with West Germany the same year. At the same time, close ties with the Arab countries (and the PLO) allowed Romania to play a key role in the Israel–Egypt and Israel–PLO peace talks. As Romania's foreign debt sharply increased between 1977 and 1981 (from US$3 billion to $10 billion), the influence of international financial organizations (such as the IMF and the World Bank) grew, gradually conflicting with Ceausescu's autocratic rule. The latter eventually initiated a policy of total reimbursement of the foreign debt by imposing austerity steps that impoverished the population and exhausted the economy. At the same time, Ceausescu greatly extended the authority of the Securitate and imposed a severe cult of personality, which led to a dramatic decrease in Ceausescu's popularity.;;;;;;;;;;X
SOV_DESC;During 1969 and 1982, very few changes took place in the politics and economy of the Soviet Union. With the beginning of the Soviet war in Afghanistan, its relationship with the United States also deteriorated. At that time Jimmy Carter, followed by Ronald Reagan was the President of the United States. Jimmy Carter ended the policy of Détente - ending of unfriendly relationship. Some historians believe that this may be one of the reasons for the Soviet Union to change its political and economic policies. The Era of Stagnation in the mid-1970s was aggravated by the war in Afghanistan in 1979 and led to a period of economic standstill between 1979 and 1985. Soviet military buildup at the expense of domestic development kept the USSR's GDP at the same level during the first half of the 1980s. Also, the cost of maintaining the Soviet Union, as a superpower was huge. These costs included running a large military, running the KGB networks, and giving money to countries close to the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Soviet Union’s technological development had fallen behind.;;;;;;;;;;X
